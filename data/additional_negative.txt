Characterization of a New Xylanase Found in the Rumen Metagenome and Its Effects on the Hydrolysis of Wheat. Wheat is the main ingredient of poultry diet, but its xylan has an adverse impact on poultry production. A novel xylanase from beef cattle rumen metagenome (RuXyn) and its effect on the wheat hydrolysis were investigated in the present study. The RuXyn coded for 377 amino acids and exhibited low identity (<40%) to previously reported proteins. The RuXyn was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and showed maximum activity at pH 6.0 and 40 °C. The activity of RuXyn could be increased by 79.8 and 36.0% in the presence of Ca2+and Tween 20, respectively. The soluble xylan and insoluble xylan in wheat could be effectively degraded by RuXyn and xylooligosaccharides produced accounting for more than 80% of the products. This study demonstrates that RuXyn has substantial potential to improve the application of wheat in poultry production by degrading wheat xylan and the accompanying xylooligosaccharides produced.
Optimizing the path of seedling low-density transplanting by using greedy genetic algorithm. Automated transplanters perform repetitive low-density transplanting and replugging of seedlings in greenhouses to resolve the labor shortage problem and consistently produce seedlings. The work efficiency of transplanters can be improved by optimizing the transplanting paths of end effectors. In this study, a greedy genetic algorithm (GGA) was developed for path optimization. GGA combines the characteristics of a greedy algorithm (GRA) and a genetic algorithm (GA). The performances of GGA, GRA, GA, and the common sequence method (CSM) in the path planning for seedling low-density transplanting were compared in terms of their optimization effects and computation time. Average transplanting paths were analyzed for sparse (32 and 50 holes) and dense (72 and 128 holes) seedling trays with 5%–20% randomly located vacant holes. Compared with the average optimization ratio of CSM, those of GA, GGA, and GRA were 10%, 8.7%, and 5.1%, respectively, for sparse trays, whereas 13.9%, 13.4%, and 11.8%, respectively, for dense trays. The standard deviations of GGA and GA overlapped in different vacant holes for the dense trays. The performance ranking of the suitable methods with short average paths was in the order of GA, GGA, and GRA. The superiority of GA over GGA gradually decreased with the increasing number of vacant and tray holes. The computation of path planning must satisfy the real-time operating requirement of transplanters. GA, GGA, and GRA consumed 9.61, 2.82, and 0.02 s, respectively, for the path planning for the dense trays. Compared with GA and GRA, GGA performed effectively in the path planning of seedling low-density transplanting due to its comprehensive performance derived from its path optimization ratio and low computation time cost. This combined optimization algorithm could have similar agricultural applications.
Sequence analysis of the membrane protein V3 of the flavivirus west nile virus and of its gene. Flaviviruses contain a large membrane-associated protein V3, having a mol mass of about 50 kDa which is responsible for hemagglutination. We have isolated the V3 protein from the West Nile (WN) flavivirus and determined its amino-terminal amino acid sequence and amino acid sequences of fragments derived from this protein. We have also transcribed parts of the WN virus genome RNA into cDNA and cloned and sequenced this CDNA. The results of these analyses have allowed us to identify the region of the viral genome coding for the V3 protein. In this report we describe the total nucleotide sequence of the genome region coding for the WN virus V3 protein and the amino acid sequence of the V3 protein derived from these analyses. The exact carboxy terminus of the V3 protein has not been determined in these experiments. These analyses have shown that the V3 protein of WN virus does not contain an Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequence which could allow addition of N-linked carbohydrate chains to this protein. In accordance with this finding, analyses of metabolic labeling of the V3 protein using [3H]glucosamine indicate that the WN virus V3 protein is an unglycosylated protein. Together with our earlier analyses these results show that the viral structural proteins are present on the genome RNA in the order 5′-terminuscore protein (V2)-small membrane-associated protein (NV2)-large membrane-associated protein (V3) and describe the nucleotide sequences coding for all WN virus structural proteins identified so far. A hypothesis concerning the processes involved in the synthesis of all viral structural proteins and the probable orientation of these proteins relative to the endoplasmatic reticulum membrane based on the structure of these proteins is discussed.
Population genomics in the arboviral vector Aedes aegypti reveals the genomic architecture and evolution of endogenous viral elements. Horizontal gene transfer from viruses to eukaryotic cells is a pervasive phenomenon. Somatic viral integrations are linked to persistent viral infection whereas integrations into germline cells are maintained in host genomes by vertical transmission and may be co-opted for host functions. In the arboviral vector Aedes aegypti, an endogenous viral element from a nonretroviral RNA virus (nrEVE) was shown to produce PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) to limit infection with a cognate virus. Thus, nrEVEs may constitute a heritable, sequence-specific mechanism for antiviral immunity, analogous to piRNA-mediated silencing of transposable elements. Here, we combine population genomics and evolutionary approaches to analyse the genomic architecture of nrEVEs in A. aegypti. We conducted a genome-wide screen for adaptive nrEVEs and searched for novel population-specific nrEVEs in the genomes of 80 individual wild-caught mosquitoes from five geographical populations. We show a dynamic landscape of nrEVEs in mosquito genomes and identified five novel nrEVEs derived from two currently circulating viruses, providing evidence of the environmental-dependent modification of a piRNA cluster. Overall, our results show that virus endogenization events are complex with only a few nrEVEs contributing to adaptive evolution in A. aegypti.
Large crown root number improves topsoil foraging and phosphorus acquisition. Suboptimal phosphorus (P) availability is a primary constraint to plant growth on Earth. We tested the hypothesis that maize (Zea mays) genotypes with large crown root number (CN) will have shallower rooting depth and improved P acquisition from low-P soils. Maize recombinant inbred lines with contrasting CN were evaluated under suboptimal P availability in greenhouse mesocosms and the field. Under P stress in mesocosms, the large-CN phenotype had 48% greater root respiration, 24% shallower rooting depth, 32% greater root length density in the topsoil, 37% greater leaf P concentration, 48% greater leaf photosynthesis, 33% greater stomatal conductance, and 44% greater shoot biomass than the small-CN phenotype. Under P stress in the field, the large-CN phenotype had 32% shallower rooting depth, 51% greater root length density in the topsoil, 44% greater leaf P concentration, 18% greater leaf photosynthesis, 21% greater stomatal conductance, 23% greater shoot biomass at anthesis, and 28% greater yield than the small-CN phenotype. These results support the hypothesis that large CN improves plant P acquisition from low-P soils by reducing rooting depth and increasing topsoil foraging. The large-CN phenotype merits consideration as a selection target to improve P capture in maize and possibly other cereal crops.
'Bacterial diversity in dry modern freshwater stromatolites from Ruidera Pools Natural Park, Spain. Ruidera Pools Natural Park, Spain, constitutes one of the most representative systems of carbonate precipitation in Europe. The prokaryotic community of a dry modern stromatolite recovered from the park has been analyzed by molecular techniques that included denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis, together with microscopic observations from the sample and cultures. Ribosomal RNA was directly extracted to study the putatively active part of the microbial community present in the sample. A total of 295 16S rRNA gene sequences were analyzed. Libraries were dominated by sequences related to Cyanobacteria, most frequently to the genus Leptolyngbya. A diverse and abundant assemblage of non-cyanobacterial sequences was also found, including members of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes and Chloroflexi groups. No amplification was obtained when using archaeal primers. The results showed that at the time of sampling, when the pool was dry, the bacterial community of the stromatolites was dominated by groups of highly related Cyanobacteria, including new groups that had not been previously reported, although a high diversity outside this phylogenetic group was also found. The results indicated that part of the Cyanobacteria assemblage was metabolically active and could thus play a role in the mineralization processes inside the stromatolites.
Functional characterization of an apple apomixis-related MhFIE gene in reproduction development. The products of the FIS genes play important regulatory roles in diverse developmental processes, especially in seed formation after fertilization. In this study, a FIS-class gene MhFIE was isolated from apple. It encoded a predicted protein highly similar to polycomb group (PcG) protein FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (FIE). MhFIE functioned as an Arabidopsis FIE homologue, as indicated by functional complementation experiment using Arabidopsis fie mutant. In addition, BiFC assay showed that MhFIE protein interacted with AtCLF. Furthermore, transgenic Arabidopsis ectopically expressing MhFIE produced less APETALA3 (AtAP3) and AGAMOUS (AtAG) transcripts than WT control, and therefore exhibited abnormal flower, seed development. These results suggested that polycomb complex including FIE and CLF proteins played an important role in reproductive development by regulating the expression of its downstream genes. In addition, it was found that MhFIE constitutively expressed in various tissues tested. Its expression levels were lower in apomictic apple species than the sexual reproductive species, suggested it was possibly involved into apomixis in apple. Furthermore, the hybrids of tea crabapple generated MhFIE transcripts at different levels. The parthenogenesis capacity was negatively correlated with MhFIE expression level in these hybrids. These results suggested that MhFIE was involved into the regulation of flower development and apomixis in apple.
Optimization and validation of methods for isolation and real-time PCR identification of protozoan oocysts on leafy green vegetables and berry fruits. Leafy green vegetables and berry fruits have vastly different physical and biochemical characteristics, are typically consumed raw with minimal washing, and are potential transmission vehicles for food-borne disease caused by protozoan parasites such as Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora and Toxoplasma. Validation of a generic oocyst isolation and detection method applicable to each leafy green and berry type is required to provide reliable laboratory support for surveillance programs and as necessary for disease outbreak investigations. The objectives of the current study were to optimize and validate the performance of these methods for the isolation of protozoan oocysts from several types of leafy greens and berries. Eimeria papillata oocysts were used as a surrogate for coccidia of public health concern to spike produce samples. An artificial stomacher or orbital shaker was used, followed by centrifugation, to isolate and concentrate oocysts, respectively, and a qPCR melt curve analysis (qPCR MCA) was used for detection and identification. Processing methods, wash buffers and storage conditions were evaluated and optimized for five types of berries (blackberries, blueberries, cranberries, raspberries and strawberries), five types of herb (cilantro, dill, mint, parsley, thyme) and green onions. Blackberries, cranberries, raspberries and strawberries were most effectively washed by orbital shaking with an elution solution, while glycine buffer was more effective for blueberries. Stomaching with a glycine buffer was optimal for oocyst recovery in leafy herbs with soft stems, while aromatic woody-stemmed herbs such as thyme required orbital shaking to minimize the release of PCR inhibitors. Oocyst recovery from green onions was highest when processed by orbital shaking with elution solution. Oocyst recovery rates ranged from 4.1-12% for berries and 5.1-15.5% for herbs and green onions. As few as 3 oocysts per gram of fruit, or 5 oocysts per gram of herbs or green onions could reliably be detected using the optimized isolation methods and qPCR MCA.
The first DNA barcodes for the Australian platypus tick ixodes ornithorhynchi lucas, 1846 (Acari: Ixodidae) to facilitate conservation efforts for a declining parasite and its host. Ixodes ornithorhynchi is one of Australia’s most cryptic tick species and is found only on the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus). The first cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) sequences for this species are presented to facilitate molecular identification and conservation of both this tick species and its host.
Fine mapping and identification of tightly linked DNA markers of blast resistance gene Pia by using an introgression line. An introgression line (INL) for a major rice blast resistance gene, Pia, was developed, with the genetic background of a blast susceptible variety, US-2. The reaction pattern of the INL was characterized by using 20 standard blast isolates from the Philippines. The introgression of the Pia gene was confirmed by DNA markers on the short arm of chromosome 11 where Pia was previously mapped. A genome-wide DNA marker survey revealed that most of the chromosomal regions were US-2 type. By using an F2 population derived from a cross between the INL and US-2, the chromosomal location of the Pia locus was mapped between RM26281 and RM3701. For fine mapping of the Pia locus, five additional markers were developed based on the genomic sequence of the corresponding region of a japonica-type variety, Nipponbare. The candidate region of Pia was delimited between two DNA markers, RM26281 and 82N19365, corresponding to a 140 kb region on the Nipponbare genome sequence. We obtained three DNA markers within this region. The developed INL, information on the map position of Pia, and DNA markers developed in the candidate region of the Pia locus are useful tools for blast resistance studies and a marker-aided breeding strategy.
Antivirals acting on viral envelopes via biophysical mechanisms of action. Most antivirals target viral proteins and are specific for only one virus, or viral type. Whereas viral proteins are encoded in the plastic viral genome, virion lipids are not and their rearrangements during fusion are conserved among otherwise unrelated enveloped viruses. Antivirals that inhibit these lipid rearrangements could thus pose a high barrier to resistance and have broad-spectrum activity. Fusion occurs through a hemifusion stalk in which only the outer leaflets are fused and thus curved with a smaller radius for the polar heads than for the hydrophobic tails (negative curvature). Outer leaflets enriched in phospholipids with head groups of larger cross sections than their lipid tails (“inverted cone”) disfavor negative curvature, inhibiting fusion. The rigid amphipathic fusion inhibitors (RAFIs) are synthetic compounds of inverted cone molecular geometry. They inhibit infectivity of otherwise unrelated enveloped viruses. The leading RAFI, aUY11, has an ethynyl-perylene hydrophobic and an uracil-arabinose polar moiety. aUY11 intercalates in viral envelopes and inhibits virion-to-cell fusion of a broad spectrum of otherwise unrelated enveloped viruses. Previous studies showed that amphipathicity, rigidity, and inverted cone molecular geometry were required. We propose that the inverted cone molecular geometry of the RAFIs increases the energy barrier for the hemifusion stalk, inhibiting fusion. Then, chemically distinct compounds with similar amphipathicity, rigidity, and inverted cone shape would have similar antiviral potencies, regardless of specific chemical groups. Alternatively, the perylene group exposed to visible light may induce viral lipid peroxidation. Then, the perylene group and absorbance at visible spectrum would be required. We now evaluated twenty-five chemically distinct RAFIs. The perylene moiety and absorption at visible spectrum were not required, but a minimum length of the hydrophobic moiety was, 10.3 Å. The arabino moiety could be modified or replaced by other groups. Cytidine was not tolerated. Bilayer intercalation was required but not sufficient. The vast majority of RAFIs had no overt cytotoxicity (CC50 > 20 μM; TI > 250–1200). Carbonyl or butylamide substitutions for arabino, or cytidine replacement for uracil, increased cytotoxicity. Cytotoxicity was mainly determined by the polar moiety and there was no correlation between antiviral and cytostatic activities. The definition of the effects of shape and chemical groups of the RAFIs opens the possibility to the rational design of lipid-acting antivirals active against a broad spectrum of enveloped viruses.
Intra-chromosomal gene conversion induced by a DNA double-strand break in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have stimulated mitotic and meiotic gene conversion between non-tandem direct repeats of ADE4 by a defined double-strand break imparted in vivo to one of two copies of the gene. The experimental design permitted us to distinguish unambiguously between reciprocal intra-chromosomal crossing over and non-reciprocal break-join events that could accompany the induced conversions. We observed that (1) less than 10% of the induced conversion events are accompanied by intra-chromosomal crossing over in both mitosis and meiosis; (2) non-reciprocal break-join is not stimulated by the double-strand breaks; (3) a double-strand break in meiosis is repaired off intra-chromosomal homology (if available) with approximately sevenfold preference over repair off the homologous chromosome. Our observations, analyzed in the light of previous investigations of spontaneous inter and intra-chromosomal crossing over and gene conversion, lead to the view that chromosomal configuration constrains intra-chromosomal crossing over accompanying conversion between closely spaced repeated genes during resolution of the conversion intermediate
Extracellular nanovesicles released from the commensal yeast Malassezia sympodialis are enriched in allergens and interact with cells in human skin. Malassezia sympodialis is a dominant commensal fungi in the human skin mycobiome but is also associated with common skin disorders including atopic eczema (AE). M. sympodialis releases extracellular vesicles, designated MalaEx, which are carriers of small RNAs and allergens, and they can induce inflammatory cytokine responses. Here we explored how MalaEx are involved in host-microbe interactions by comparing protein content of MalaEx with that of the parental yeast cells, and by investigating interactions of MalaEx with cells in the skin. Cryo-electron tomography revealed a heterogeneous population of MalaEx. iTRAQ based quantitative proteomics identified in total 2439 proteins in all replicates of which 110 were enriched in MalaEx compared to the yeast cells. Among the MalaEx enriched proteins were two of the M. sympodialis allergens, Mala s 1 and s 7. Functional experiments indicated an active binding and internalization of MalaEx into human keratinocytes and monocytes, and MalaEx were found in close proximity of the nuclei using super-resolution fluorescence 3D-SIM imaging. Our results provides new insights into host-microbe interactions, supporting that MalaEx may have a role in the sensitization and maintenance of inflammation in AE by containing enriched amounts of allergens and with their ability to interact with skin cells.
Comparison of microplate hybridization with gel electrophoresis and dot blot hybridization for the rapid detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR products.. A microplate ELISA hybridization assay has been developed for the detection of the IS6110 PCR products of M. tuberculosis from sputum specimens. In this study, its efficacy was evaluated by comparison with agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) and dot blot hybridization (DBH), with culture results as the 'gold standard'. The assay was used with 190 sputum samples: the PCR results detected by ELISA and AGE showed close agreement, with sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 90%, 100% and 96% respectively. The same values for DBH were 92%, 98% and 96% respectively. The validities of these methods were not statistically significantly different (p>0.05). The agreement rates of PCR product detection by AGE comparing with DBH and ELISA were 0.964 and 0.964 respectively, while that of DBH and ELISA was 1.0 by Kappa analysis. The overall agreement was not statistically significantly different (p>0.05). Use of DBH or ELISA hybridization increased the sensitivity of detection by AGE 10-fold from 10 pg to 1 pg of purified DNA per reaction; ie from about 30 to about 3 organisms. The amount of PCR product detected by ELISA was only one half of that detected by the other methods; the total assay time of ELISA following the PCR was 4 hours. In conclusion, the microplate hybridization assay may replace AGE and DBH for the detection of the PCR products of M. tuberculosis because of its sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Additional advantages of the microplate assay over AGE and DBH include rapidity, ease of use, greater safety, cost effectiveness and greater objectivity in the reading of results; the technique is suitable for use in epidemiological studies for the analysis of a large number of samples.
'Revealing cell cycle control by combining model-based detection of periodic expression with novel cis-regulatory descriptors. Background: We address the issue of explaining the presence or absence of phase-specific transcription in budding yeast cultures under different conditions. To this end we use a model-based detector of gene expression periodicity to divide genes into classes depending on their behavior in experiments using different synchronization methods. While computational inference of gene regulatory circuits typically relies on expression similarity (clustering) in order to find classes of potentially co-regulated genes, this method instead takes advantage of known time profile signatures related to the studied process. Results: We explain the regulatory mechanisms of the inferred periodic classes with cis-regulatory descriptors that combine upstream sequence motifs with experimentally determined binding of transcription factors. By systematic statistical analysis we show that periodic classes are best explained by combinations of descriptors rather than single descriptors, and that different combinations correspond to periodic expression in different classes. We also find evidence for additive regulation in that the combinations of cis-regulatory descriptors associated with genes periodically expressed in fewer conditions are frequently subsets of combinations associated with genes periodically expression in more conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach retrieves combinations that are more specific towards known cell-cycle related regulators than the frequently used clustering approach. Conclusion: The results illustrate how a model-based approach to expression analysis may be particularly well suited to detect biologically relevant mechanisms. Our new approach makes it possible to provide more refined hypotheses about regulatory mechanisms of the cell cycle and it can easily be adjusted to reveal regulation of other, non-periodic, cellular processes.
Optimization Method of IR Thermography Facial Image Registration. So far, there have been many types of researches subject to technical requirements due to image registration. Using image registration can lower deviation from sequential images and make it possible to analyze the information variation of the particular area subsequently. This study provides a procedure creating fixed image based on the data of facial IR thermography, where its methods include the visual saliency map by detected image, as well as cluster algorithm. Comparison is also made here to solve the merits and demerits by affine parameter to reach the optimum measure among Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Simulated Annealing Algorithm, where there are two control parameters concerning this experiment: one is the calculation of time confined each alignment, while the other one is to use parallel computing toolbox or not. The optimum method will be chosen by the values of the objective function based on the control parameters. Afterward, the optimal internal parameter is to be verified through the Taguchi experiment and the validity of this procedure in this study will be built following the parameter result as above. Therefore, the difference of images before and after alignment can be validated by overlapping the images before and after alignment as well as the image quality measurements, where its results reveal that the alignment procedure of IR thermography in this study is capable of performing human face alignment precisely, and subsequently, do help data statistics and analysis concerning temperature area interdependence.
The cellodextrinase from Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa consists of multiple functional domains. A genomic library of Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa DNA was constructed in pUC18 and Escherichia coli recombinants expressing 4-methylumbelliferyl β-D-cellobioside-hydrolysing activity (MUCase) were isolated. Enzyme produced by MUCase-positive clones did not hydrolyse either cellobiose or cellotriose but converted celiotetraose into cellobiose and eleaved cellopentaose and cellohexaose, producing a mixture of cellobiose and cellotriose. There was no activity against CM-cellulose, insoluble cellulose or xylan. On this basis, the enzyme is identified as an endo-acting cellodextrinase and is designated cellodextrinase C (CELC). Nucleotide sequencing of the gene (celC) which directs the synthesis of CELC revealed an open reading frame of 2153 bp, encoding a protein of M(r) 80189. The deduced primary sequence of CELC was confirmed by thc M(r) of purified CELC (77000) and by the experimentally determined N-terminus of the enzyme which was identical with residues 38-47 of the translated sequence. The N-terminal region of CELC showed strong homology with endoglucanase, xylanases and an arabinofuranosidase of Ps. fluorescens subsp. cellulosa; homologous sequences included highly conserved serine-rich regions. Full-length CELC bound tightly to crystalline cellulose. Truncated forms of celC from which the DNA sequence encoding the conserved domain had been deleted, directed the synthesis of a functional cellodextrinase that did not bind to crystalline cellulose. This is consistent with the N-terminal region of CELC comprising a non-catalytic cellulose-binding domain which is distinct from thc catalytic domain. The role of the cellulose-binding region is discussed.
Transport of D-galactose by the gastrointestinal tract of the locust, Locusta migratoria. Due to exoskeleton, the absorption of nutrients in adult insects takes place across the gastrointestinal tract epithelium. In most physiological studies, sugar intestinal absorption has been described as a diffusional process and to date no sugar transporter has been cloned from the digestive tract of insects. In the present work, the existence of a saturable transport system for galactose in the gastric caeca of Locusta migratoria is clearly demonstrated. This transport shows a relatively high affinity for galactose (apparent K 0.5 = 2-3 mM) and is inhibited by glucose, 2-deoxyglucose and with less potency by fructose and α-methyl-d-glucoside. The absence of sodium or the presence of phloridzin hardly affects galactose absorption, indicating that it is not mediated by a SGLT1-like transporter. The absence of K +, Cl-, Mg2+ and Ca2+ or changes in the pH do not modify galactose absorption either. Nevertheless, phloretin, cytochalasin B and theophylline (inhibitors of facilitative transporters) decrease sugar uptake around 50%. Xenopus laevis oocytes microinjected with poly A+ RNA isolated from gastric caeca show sodium-independent galactose uptake that is three times higher than in non-injected oocytes, further supporting the existence of a mRNA coding for at least one equilibrative sugar transporter in L. migratoria gastric caeca.
Anti-leukemic activities of alcoholic extracts of two traditional Indian medicinal plants. The present work aimed to investigate the anticancer in vitro activity of two plants commonly used in traditional Indian medicine: Zingiber officinale Roscoe and Nerium oleander L. The extracts of these plants were tested in vitro on several human leukemic cell lines, K562, THP-1, MOLT-4 and Jurkat. Cell growth inhibition was observed for both plant extracts with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ranging between 1 and 28 g/mL using SRB (sulphorodamine B) and MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] assays. Enhanced cell growth inhibition was observed when the extracts were combined with imatinib. Exposed cells showed cell cycle arrest, DNA damage and cytochrome c release, indicating that the mechanism of cytotoxicity could be via mitochondrial mediated apoptotic pathways. Combination of the extracts of these plants with standard cancer treatment may be a way of enhancing responses. Clinical studies in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia are planned at our center.
Cholesterol-lowering effects of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Musa sapientum Linn.. Hypercholesterolemia is generally recognised as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Musa sapientum Linn. or Kluai Namwa (banana; ABB genome type) provides a functional nutrient in health promotion products and is a source of various probiotics. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from several sources are reported with cholesterol-lowering potential. However, the effects of LAB isolated from bananas on total cholesterol are still unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the cholesterol-removing ability of 5 LAB strains isolated from raw M. sapientum. All tested strains show a cholesterol-lowering property in species-and strain-dependent manner, with Weissella paramesenteroides NR27 being the most effective probiotic in reducing cholesterol concentration (P < 0.001). The removal of cholesterol by LAB is partially due to the production of bile salt hydrolase. All tested isolates exhibit more than 75% and 50% survival rates after challenging with simulated gastric and intestinal fluids respectively. Of these, W. paramesenteroides NR27 has a significantly higher survival rate (80%) in gastrointestinal conditions (P < 0.001), compared with all tested strains. In addition, antibiotic-resistant genes are not present in all drugs tested on this isolate. Therefore, W. paramesenteroides NR27 could be a promising probiotic candidate for reducing total cholesterol.
From molecules to multispecies ecosystems: The roles of structure in bacterial biofilms. Biofilms are communities of sessile microbes that are bound to each other by a matrix made of biopolymers and proteins. Spatial structure is present in biofilms on many lengthscales. These range from the nanometer scale of molecular motifs to the hundred-micron scale of multicellular aggregates. Spatial structure is a physical property that impacts the biology of biofilms in many ways. The molecular structure of matrix components controls their interaction with each other (thereby impacting biofilm mechanics) and with diffusing molecules such as antibiotics and immune factors (thereby impacting antibiotic tolerance and evasion of the immune system). The size and structure of multicellular aggregates, combined with microbial consumption of growth substrate, give rise to differentiated microenvironments with different patterns of metabolism and gene expression. Spatial association of more than one species can benefit one or both species, while distances between species can both determine and result from the transport of diffusible factors between species. Thus, a widespread theme in the biological importance of spatial structure in biofilms is the effect of structure on transport. We survey what is known about this and other effects of spatial structure in biofilms, from molecules up to multispecies ecosystems. We conclude with an overview of what experimental approaches have been developed to control spatial structure in biofilms and how these and other experiments can be complemented with computational work.
Establishment of a nested-ASP-PCR method to determine the clarithromycin resistance of Helicobacter pylori. AIM: To investigate clarithromycin resistance positions 2142, 2143 and 2144 of the 23SrRNA gene in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori ) by nested-allele specific primer-polymerase chain reaction (nested-ASP-PCR). METHODS: The gastric tissue and saliva samples from 99 patients with positive results of the rapid urease test (RUT) were collected. The nested-ASP-PCR method was carried out with the external primers and inner allele-specific primers corresponding to the reference strain and clinical strains. Thirty gastric tissue and saliva samples were tested to determine the sensitivity of nested-ASP-PCR and ASP-PCR methods. Then, clarithromycin resistance was detected for 99 clinical samples by using different methods, including nested- ASP-PCR, bacterial culture and disk diffusion. RESULTS: The nested-ASP-PCR method was successfully established to test the resistance mutation points 2142, 2143 and 2144 of the 23SrRNA gene of H. pylori . Among 30 samples of gastric tissue and saliva, the H. pylori detection rate of nested-ASP-PCR was 90% and 83.33%, while the detection rate of ASP-PCR was just 63% and 56.67%. Especially in the saliva samples, nested-ASP-PCR showed much higher sensitivity in H. pylori detection and resistance mutation rates than ASP-PCR. In the 99 RUT-positive gastric tissue and saliva samples, the H. pylori -positive detection rate by nested-ASP-PCR was 87 (87.88%) and 67 (67.68%), in which there were 30 wild-type and 57 mutated strains in gastric tissue and 22 wild-type and 45 mutated strains in saliva. Genotype analysis showed that three-points mixed mutations were quite common, but different resistant strains were present in gastric mucosa and saliva. Compared to the high sensitivity shown by nested-ASP-PCR, the positive detection of bacterial culture with gastric tissue samples was 50 cases, in which only 26 drug-resistant strains were found through analyzing minimum inhibitory zone of clarithromycin. CONCLUSION: The nested-ASP-PCR assay showed higher detection sensitivity than ASP-PCR and drug sensitivity testing, which could be performed to evaluate clarithromycin resistance of H. pylori.
Stomatal and photochemical limitations of photosynthesis in coffee (Coffea spp.) plants subjected to elevated temperatures. Temperature increase assumes a prominent role in the context of expected climate change because of its significant impact on plant metabolism. High temperature can affect the carbon-assimilation pathway at both stomatal and non-stomatal levels, mainly through stomatal closure and photochemical and biochemical limitations. In general, however, plants have some ability to trigger acclimation mechanisms to cope with stressful conditions, especially if the limitations are imposed in a gradual manner during seasonal change. This study aims at evaluating changes at stomatal and photochemical levels in Coffea arabica and C. canephora under exposure to mild temperature (spring) and high temperature (summer). Potted plants were maintained in a greenhouse, watered to field capacity and subject to natural variations of light, temperature and relative humidity. In C. arabica, exposure to summer conditions decreased photosynthetic rates (A), stomatal conductance (gs) and stomatal density and increased intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) compared with spring values, whereas C. canephora plants maintained similar values in both seasons. However, C. canephora presented lower A and gs during spring than C. arabica. Because photosynthetic capacity (Amax), photosynthetic performance index and membrane permeability were similar between genotypes and seasons, and maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) and photosynthetic pigments were not affected in C. arabica in summer, we conclude that under high temperature conditions, stomatal closure imposes the major limitation on C. arabica photosynthesis in summer. Finally, both coffee genotypes were able to avoid damage to photochemistry pathway under supra-optimal temperatures.
Integrated Optimization for EEDI and Minimum Propulsion Power. A practical integrated optimization model for EEDI and minimum propulsion power has been established. Main focus of this study is on the development of an efficient and effective method to optimize ship's main dimensions when targeting EEDI under the constraint of minimum propulsion power. The objective function EEDI associated with the resistance and self-propulsion performance is evaluated by the digital pattern of hydrodynamics performance for tanker series. Hull form deformation can be achieved by combining affine transformation and Lackenby's method, and the genetic algorithm is adopted. For the purpose of illustration, a VLCC has been chosen for the integrated optimization. It is shown that the integrated optimization model is reasonable and effective.
Expression of the Legume-Specific Nod Factor Receptor Proteins Alters Developmental and Immune Responses in Rice. Legumes form symbiosis with rhizobia, which fix nitrogen for the benefit of host plant in return for carbon resources. Development of this unique symbiosis in legumes is triggered by rhizobia-secreted nodulation (Nod) factors (NFs). NFs, upon perception, activate Nod signaling cascade, leading to reprogramming of host cell (root) developmental networks to pave way for accommodating rhizobial symbionts. A long-cherished goal of legume-rhizobia symbiosis research is to extend this symbiotic nitrogen-fixing capacity to cereal plants such as rice. As a part of achieving this ultimate goal, in this work, initially we expressed legume-specific Nod factor receptor protein (NFRP) genes, MtNFP, MtLYK3, and LjLNP, in rice and assessed their impact on NF perception and consequently triggered biological responses in roots. RNA-seq analysis revealed that roots of both control and NFRP-expressing plants perceive NFs, but NFs elicited contrasting impacts on gene expression patterns in roots of these plants. In contrast to suppressive role of NFs on expression of several genes involved in innate immune response in roots of control plants, in NFRP-expressing plants, NFs triggered massive upregulation of a vast array of genes associated with signaling, defense response, and secondary metabolism networks in roots. Expression of NFRPs in rice also conferred root hairs the ability to respond to NFs in terms of exhibiting deformations, albeit at low levels. Together, results of the study demonstrated that rice plants have inherent ability to perceive NFs, but the expression of legume NFRPs rendered rice roots hypersensitive to NFs.
High level secretion of recombinant staphylokinase into periplasm of Escherichia coli. The staphylokinase (SAK) gene from Staphylococcus aureus NCTC10033 was inserted into an expression vector, pKK-ompA, having a tac promoter and an ompA signal sequence. Escherchia coli JM109 carrying the recombinant plasmid produced and secreted the recombinant SAK (rSAK) at 15 ug/ml into periplasm and 5 ug/ml to extracellular media, respectively. The rSAK was purified with 59% yield by simple procedures from the periplasm of E. coli. The aminoterminal sequence and human plasminogen activating activity of rSAK were coincided with the authentic SAK.
Diagnosis and treatment of caprine dermatophilosis - A case report. A malabari doe presented with a history of skin problem and pruritus was diagnosed as dermatophilosis based on cultural isolation and identi- fication is reported. Molecular confirmation was done using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to amplify a 500 bp fragment of the 16S rRNA gene of D. congolensis.The animal was treated with Enrocin (Inj. Enrofloxacin) at a dose rate of 7 mg/kg body weight I/M once daily for three daysalong with topical povidone iodine application.
Positive selection in phytotoxic protein-encoding genes of Botrytis species. Evolutionary patterns of sequence divergence were analyzed in genes from the fungal genus Botrytis (Ascomycota), encoding phytotoxic proteins homologous to a necrosis and ethylene-inducing protein from Fusarium oxysporum. Fragments of two paralogous genes (designated NEP1 and NEP2) were amplified from all known Botrytis species and sequenced. NEP1 sequences of two Botrytis species contain premature stop codons, indicating that they may be non-functional. Both paralogs of all species encode proteins with a remarkably similar predicted secondary structure, however, they contain different types of post-translational modification motifs, which are conserved across the genus. While both NEP genes are, overall, under purifying selection, we identified a number of amino acids under positive selection based on inference using maximum likelihood models. Positively selected amino acids in NEP1 were not under selection in corresponding positions in NEP2. The biological significance of positively selected residues and the role of NEP proteins in pathogenesis remain to be resolved.
Introgressive hybridization between bighead carp and silver carp in the Mississippi and Illinois rivers. Asian carps are classified as either bighead carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis or silver carp H. molitrix by multiple presumptively diagnostic morphological characteristics; however, hybrids pose a dilemma. Fish sharing the morphological characteristics of both species were observed in an Illinois River backwater (Calhoun County, Illinois) approximately 5 mi (8 km) upriver from the confluence with the Mississippi River as well as in two locations in Pool 26 of the Mississippi River (Madison County, Illinois). Biopsied tissues from individuals exhibiting mixed morphological features were analyzed at four diagnostic allozyme loci (ADH-1*, sMDH-A*, CK-A*, and sSOD-1*) via starch gel electrophoresis. This comparison revealed a high percentage of hybridization (22.5%) from an indiscriminate sample of 120 fish. Moreover, an unexpected percentage (12.5%) of individuals identified in the wild as either parental bighead carp or silver carp by gill raker morphology were genetically identified as hybrids. Finally, two levels of hybridization were detected, first-generation hybrids (F1) and post-F1 hybrids, revealing the onset of extensive introgression and the potential for a hybrid swarm. Variation in the amplified COII domain of mitochondrial DNA indicated a strong directional bias of hybrids (88%) containing silver carp maternal lineages. Morphologically, F1 hybrids were often identifiable (88%) by the presence of twisted gill rakers, but post-F1 hybrids were difficult to identify with any appreciable certainty. This result creates concern where taxonomic assignment is critical for management or monitoring, warranting a more extensive and intensive examination of this phenomenon in North American waters. Finally, prior observations in aquaculture have shown reduced jumping behavior, fitness, and condition of fish resulting from post-F1 matings between these species. This is the first confirmed presence of wild post-F1 individuals of Asian carps in the United States and, although further monitoring is needed, a hybrid swarm may ultimately decrease invasion success as introgression continues.
Analysis of the genome sequence of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana is an important model system for identifying genes end determining their functions. Here we report the analysis of the genomic sequence of Arabidopsis. The sequenced regions cover 115.4 megabases of the 125-megabase genome and extend into centromeric regions. The evolution of Arabidopsis involved a whole-genome duplication, followed by subsequent gene loss and extensive local gene duplications, giving rise to a dynamic genome enriched by lateral gene transfer from a cyanobacterial-like ancestor of the plastid. The genome contains 25,498 genes encoding proteins from 11,000 families, similar to the functional diversity of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans - the other sequenced multicellular eukaryotes. Arabidopsis has many families of new proteins but also lacks several common protein families, indicating that the sets of common proteins have undergone differential expansion and contraction in the three multicellular eukaryotes. This is the first complete genome sequence of a plant and provides the foundations for more comprehensive comparison of conserved processes in all eukaryotes, identifying a wide range of plant-specific gene functions and establishing rapid systematic ways to identify genes for crop improvement.
In vivo cytogenetic and oxidative stress-inducing effects of cypermethrin in freshwater fish, Channa punctata Bloch. Synthetic pyrethroids are considered to be safe over other insecticides. Many of the newest pyrethroids lack ecotoxicity data. However, animal data indicate that their use may pose risk to environmental biota. The cytogenetic effects of cypermethrin, an α-class type II pyrethroid were evaluated using robust genotoxicity assay of chromosomal aberration (CA) and micronucleus (MN) tests in highly mitotic kidney cells and in erythrocytes of a freshwater fish, Channa punctata Bloch. In order to understand biochemical mechanism of genotoxic effects, oxidative stress parameters were also studied in fish erythrocytes. Fish exposed to cypermethrin (0.4, 0.8 and 1.2. γg/l for 48 and 72 h) showed increased frequencies of CA and MN in a concentration-dependent manner. Fish exposed to positive genotoxin, ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) also showed significant increase in frequencies of CA and MN. The genotoxic effects were invariably accompanied and correlated with increased oxidative stress and disturbance of antioxidant enzymes.
In Vitro Enzymatic Activities of Bacteriochlorophyll a Synthase Derived from the Green Sulfur Photosynthetic Bacterium Chlorobaculum tepidum. The activity of an enzyme encoded by the CT1610 gene in the green sulfur photosynthetic bacterium Chlorobaculum tepidum, which was annotated as bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) a synthase, BchG (denoted as tepBchG), was examined in vitro using the lysates of Escherichia coli containing the heterologously expressed enzyme. BChl a possessing a geranylgeranyl group at the 17-propionate residue (BChl aGG) was produced from bacteriochlorophyllide (BChlide) a and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate in the presence of tepBchG. Surprisingly, tepBchG catalyzed the formation of BChl a bearing a farnesyl group (BChl aF) as in the enzymatic production of BChl aGG, indicating loose recognition of isoprenoid pyrophosphates in tepBchG. In contrast to such loose recognition of isoprenoid substrates, BChlide c and chlorophyllide a gave no esterifying product upon being incubated with geranylgeranyl or farnesyl pyrophosphate in the presence of tepBchG. These results confirm that tepBchG undoubtedly acts as the BChl a synthase in Cba. tepidum. The enzymatic activity of tepBchG was higher than that of BchG of Rhodobacter sphaeroides at 45 °C, although the former activity was lower than the latter below 35 °C.
Sialic acid-specific lectins: Occurrence, specificity and function. Sialic acids consist of a family of acidic nine-carbon sugars that are typically located at the terminal positions of a variety of glycoconjugates. Naturally occurring sialic acids show an immense diversity of structure, and this reflects their involvement in a variety of biologically important processes. One such process involves the direct participation of sialic acids in recognition events through specific interactions with lectins, a family of proteins that recognise and bind sugars. This review will present a detailed overview of our current knowledge regarding the occurrence, specificity and function of sialic acid-specific lectins, particularly those that occur in viruses, bacteria and non-vertebrate eukaryotes.
Direct detection of Coccidioides from Arizona soils using CocciENV, a highly sensitive and specific real-time PCR assay. Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii are soil fungi endemic to desert regions of the southwestern United States, and the causative agents of valley fever, or coccidioidomycosis. Studies have shown that the distribution of Coccidioides in soils is sporadic and cannot be explained by soil characteristics alone, suggesting that biotic and other abiotic factors should be examined. However, tools to reliably and robustly screen the large number of soils needed to investigate these potential associations have not been available. Thus, we developed a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for testing environmental samples by modifying CocciDx, an assay validated for testing clinical specimens to facilitate coccidioidomycosis diagnosis. For this study, we collected soil samples from previously established locations of C. posadasii in Arizona and new locations in fall 2013 and spring 2014, and screened the extracted DNA with the new assay known as CocciEnv. To verify the presence of Coccidioides in soil using an alternate method, we employed next generation amplicon sequencing targeting the ITS2 region. Results show our modified assay, CocciEnv, is a rapid and robust method for detecting Coccidioides DNA in complex environmental samples. The ability to test a large number of soils for the presence of Coccidioides is a much-needed tool in the understanding of the ecology of the organism and epidemiology of the disease and will greatly improve our understanding of this human pathogen.
Comparison of the mitochondrial genome of Nicotiana tabacum with its progenitor species. Mitochondrial DNAs from Nicotiana tabacum, an amphiploid, and its putative progenitor species, N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis were compared in structure and organization. By using DNA transfer techniques and cloned fragments of known genes from maize and N. sylvestris as labeled probes, the positions of homologous sequences in restriction digests of the Nicotiana species were analyzed. Results indicate that the mitochondrial DNA of N. tabacum was inherited from N. sylvestris. Conservation in organization and sequence homology between mtDNAs of N. tabacum and the maternal progenitor, N. sylvestris, provide evidence that the mitochondrial genome in these species is evolutionarily stable. Approximately one-third of the probed restriction fragments of N. tomentosiformis mtDNA showed conservation of position with the other two species. Pattern variations indicate that extensive rearrangement of mtDNA has occurred in the evolution of these Nicotiana species.
Formalized classification of ephemeral wetland vegetation (Isoëto-Nanojuncetea class) in Poland (Central Europe). Formalized classification of the class Isoëto-Nanojuncetea has not been performed in Poland. We used 69,562 relevés stored in Polish Vegetation Database. Based on the literature and expert knowledge we selected 63 diagnostic species for the Isoëto-Nanojuncetea class. Unequivocal classification was applied in this work according to Cocktail method. A set of formal definitions was established using a combination of logical operators of total cover of species in case of high-rank syntaxa while sociological species groups and cover of particular species were used for logical formulas describing class, alliances and associations. An Expert System was prepared and applied to classify the whole data set of PVD and 1,340 relevés were organized at the class level. We stratifies the data and finally we used data set of 903 relevés to prepare synoptic tables, distribution maps and descriptions of the syntaxa. Twelve associations and two plant communities were identified. Vegetation of the Isoëto-Nanojuncetea class occur in Poland's central and southern part, with scattered stands in northern region. We described two new plant communities within Eleocharition and Radiolion alliance. The first formal classification of the Isoëto-Nanojuncetea class revealed a high diversity of ephemeral vegetation wetland found in Poland in the eastern boundary of their geographical distribution in Europe.
Genomics of an extreme psychrophile, Psychromonas ingrahamii. Background: The genome sequence of the sea-ice bacterium Psychromonas ingrahamii 37, which grows exponentially at -12C, may reveal features that help to explain how this extreme psychrophile is able to grow at such low temperatures. Determination of the whole genome sequence allows comparison with genes of other psychrophiles and mesophiles. Results: Correspondence analysis of the composition of all P. ingrahamii proteins showed that (1) there are 6 classes of proteins, at least one more than other bacteria, (2) integral inner membrane proteins are not sharply separated from bulk proteins suggesting that, overall, they may have a lower hydrophobic character, and (3) there is strong opposition between asparagine and the oxygen-sensitive amino acids methionine, arginine, cysteine and histidine and (4) one of the previously unseen clusters of proteins has a high proportion of "orphan" hypothetical proteins, raising the possibility these are cold-specific proteins. Based on annotation of proteins by sequence similarity, (1) P. ingrahamii has a large number (61) of regulators of cyclic GDP, suggesting that this bacterium produces an extracellular polysaccharide that may help sequester water or lower the freezing point in the vicinity of the cell. (2) P. ingrahamii has genes for production of the osmolyte, betaine choline, which may balance the osmotic pressure as sea ice freezes. (3) P. ingrahamii has a large number (11) of three-subunit TRAP systems that may play an important role in the transport of nutrients into the cell at low temperatures. (4) Chaperones and stress proteins may play a critical role in transforming nascent polypeptides into 3-dimensional configurations that permit low temperature growth. (5) Metabolic properties of P. ingrahamii were deduced. Finally, a few small sets of proteins of unknown function which may play a role in psychrophily have been singled out as worthy of future study. Conclusion: The results of this genomic analysis provide a springboard for further investigations into mechanisms of psychrophily. Focus on the role of asparagine excess in proteins, targeted phenotypic characterizations and gene expression investigations are needed to ascertain if and how the organism regulates various proteins in response to growth at lower temperatures.
Study of RecA-independent homologous recombination and a chromosomal rearrangement in the Escherichia coli strain carrying an extended heterozygous tandem duplication. A heterozygous tandem duplication. in the Escherichia coli deo operon region deoA deoB::Tn5/ deoC deoD thr::Tn9 with the total length approximately 150 kb, which was obtained in the conjugational mating in the HfrH strain, was examined. By means of digestion with the NotI enzyme, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and the conjugational transfer of the duplication in the F - strain, the chromosomal rearrangement, which occurred in the duplication region upon its stabilization in the bacterial genome, was studied. In a more stable strain, two new NotI sites were shown to appear in the chromosomal region located close to the duplication, which might have resulted from the transposition of the IS50 sequence from Tn5. The data were also obtained indicating the possibility of secondary transposition of the chromosomal segment between the two new NotI sites (approximately 30 kb) in the region located near the duplication. With the use of rec+ and recA strains, two types of haploid and diploid segregants generated by the duplication were studied: DeoD+ (the DeoD+ allele is not expressed in the original duplication due to the polar effect of the deoB::Tn5 insertion) and DeoC DeoD. The segregation of DeoD+ clones was shown to be RecA-dependent, whereas the DeoC DeoD segregants selected on the medium that contained thymine at a low concentration (i.e., under conditions of thymine starvation) appeared at a rather high frequency. However, the relative frequency of haploid clones, which have lost the duplication, strongly decreased in the recA genome among segregants of both types.
Diversity of olfactory responses and skills in astyanax mexicanus cavefish populations inhabiting different caves. Animals in many phyla are adapted to and thrive in the constant darkness of subterranean environments. To do so, cave animals have presumably evolved mechano-and chemosensory compensations to the loss of vision, as is the case for the blind characiform cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus. Here, we systematically assessed the olfactory capacities of cavefish and surface fish of this species in the lab as well as in the wild, in five different caves in northeastern Mexico, using an olfactory setup specially developed to test and record olfactory responses during fieldwork. Overall cavefish showed lower (i.e., better) olfactory detection thresholds than surface fish. However, wild adult cavefish from the Pachón, Sabinos, Tinaja, Chica and Subterráneo caves showed highly variable responses to the three different odorant molecules they were exposed to. Pachón and Subterráneo cavefish showed the highest olfactory capacities, and Chica cavefish showed no response to the odors presented. We discuss these data with regard to the environmental conditions in which these different cavefish populations live. Our experiments in natural settings document the diversity of cave environments inhabited by a single species of cavefish, A. mexicanus, and highlight the complexity of the plastic and genetic mechanisms that underlie cave adaptation.
Plants transformed with a tobacco mosaic virus nonstructural gene sequence are resistant to the virus. Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi nn plants were transformed with nucleotides 3472-4916 of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) strain U1. This sequence contains all but the three 3′ terminal nucleotides of the TMV 54-kDa gene, which encodes a putative component of the replicase complex. These plants were resistant to infection when challenged with either TMV U1 virions or TMV U1 RNA at concentrations of up to 500 μg/ml or 300 μg/ml, respectively, the highest concentrations tested. Resistance was also exhibited when plants were inoculated at 100 μg/ml with the closely related TMV mutant YSI/1 but was not shown in plants challenged at the same concentrations with the more distantly related TMV strains U2 or L or cucumber mosaic virus. Although the copy number of the 54-kDa gene sequence varied in individual transformants from 1 to ≈5, the level of resistance in plants was not dependent on the number of copies of the 54-kDa gene sequence integrated. The transformed plants accumulated a 54-kDa gene sequence-specific RNA transcript of the expected size, but no protein product was detected.
Evaluation of the Marine Bacterial Population in the Great Bitter Lake, Egypt, as a Source of Antimicrobial Secondary Metabolites. The ecological uniqueness of the Great Bitter Lake ecosystem makes its bacterial population interesting for investigation. Here, we present the first trial to evaluate the biosynthetic capacity of the bacterial population at the lake as a source of novel antimicrobials. We collected different samples from various locations throughout the lake including the oxic sediment, anoxic sediment, shore water, and off-shore water. We modified a molecular approach to compare and choose the samples with the highest bacterial biosynthetic capacity by quantifying the polyketide synthase gene clusters in their total community DNA. Furthermore, we screened the bacterial isolates recovered from these samples and their metabolic extracts for antimicrobial activity. We tried to tentatively investigate the identity of the active metabolites by PCR screening and LC–MS. The bacterial population in the oxic sediment had the highest biosynthetic capacity compared to other sample types. Four active Bacillus isolates were identified. The isolated Bacillus species were expected to produce numerous probable bioactive metabolites encoded by biosynthetic gene clusters related to the polyketide synthases (either individual or hybrid with non-ribosomal peptide synthetase), such as Bacillomycin D, Iturin A, Bacilosarcin B, Bacillcoumacin G and Macrolactin (N and G). These results suggest that the underexplored bacterial community of the Great Bitter Lake has a prospective biosynthetic capacity and can be a promising source for novel antibiotics.
Light-dependent phosphorylation of the carboxy tail of mouse melanopsin. Melanopsin-based phototransduction is involved in non-image forming light responses including circadian entrainment, pupil constriction, suppression of pineal melatonin synthesis, and direct photic regulation of sleep in vertebrates. Given that the functions of melanopsin involve the measurement and summation of total environmental luminance, there would appear to be no need for the rapid deactivation typical of other G-protein coupled receptors. In this study, however, we demonstrate that heterologously expressed mouse melanopsin is phosphorylated in a light-dependent manner, and that this phosphorylation is involved in regulating the rate of G-protein activation and the lifetime of melanopsin's active state. Furthermore, we provide evidence for lightdependent phosphorylation of melanopsin in the mouse retina using an in situ proximity ligation assay. Finally, we demonstrate that melanopsin preferentially interacts with the GRK2/3 family of G-protein coupled receptor kinases through co-immunoprecipitation assays. Based on the complement of G-protein receptor kinases present in the melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells, GRK2 emerges as the best candidate for melanopsin's cognate GRK.
Modeling and Parameter Identification for a Flexible Rotor With Impacts. The accuracy of a multibody model to predict the behavior of a real physical system depends heavily on the correct choice of model parameters. Identifying unknown system parameters that cannot be computed or measured directly is usually time-consuming and costly. If measurement data is available for the physical system, the parameters in the corresponding mathematical model can be determined by minimizing the error between the model response and the measurement data using optimization methods. While there is a wide range of optimization methods available, genetic optimization is a more generic approach for finding optimal solutions to complex engineering problems. So far, however, there is no general approach on how to use genetic optimization to determine unknown system parameters automatically—which is, however, of great importance when dealing with real flexible multibody systems. In this paper, we present a methodology to automatically determine several unknown system parameters of a complex flexible multibody system using genetic optimization. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using a small-scale test problem and a real flexible rotor excited with impacts. Experiments were performed on the physical rotor to obtain measurement data which is used to identify bearing and support stiffness and damping parameters as well as the impact force.
Monte Carlo strategies for selecting parameter values in simulation experiments. Simulation experiments are used widely throughout evolutionary biology and bioinformatics to comparemodels, promote methods, and test hypotheses. The biggest practical constraint on simulation experiments is the computational demand, particularly as the number of parameters increases. Given the extraordinary success of Monte Carlo methods for conducting inference in phylogenetics, and indeed throughout the sciences, we investigate ways in which Monte Carlo framework can be used to carry out simulation experiments more efficiently. The key idea is to sample parameter values for the experiments, rather than iterate through them exhaustively. Exhaustive analyses become completely infeasible when the number of parameters gets too large, whereas sampled approaches can fare better in higher dimensions. We illustrate the framework with applications to phylogenetics and genetic archaeology.
Allelic variation of gliadin-encoding genes in a collection of tetraploid wheat genotypes. Wheat is one of the main crops bred worldwide. Durum wheat, specifically, is a key element of the Mediterranean diet, representing an élite crop grown in Italy. Durum wheat nutritional and technological values are largely due to the grain protein content (GPC), a complex genetic trait strongly affected by environmental factors and management practices. In the last decades, several breeding programs have been focused on improving GPC by both traditional and innovative approaches. Among seed storage proteins, prolamins, including both gliadins and glutenins, represent the major component. These two classes of proteins are indeed responsible of gluten formation and confer the extensibility and elasticity to the dough. Besides being of crucial importance for both technological properties and rheological characteristics, prolamins, and especially gliadins, have been found to be major triggers for human health, as involved in a number of wheat consumption-related conditions, such as the celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, defined as the onset of a variety of manifestations related to wheat, rye and barley ingestion, and wheat allergies, both due to wheat ingestion or inhalation (of flour or pollen). The identification of loci responsible for the gliadin expression, and particularly of polymorphism in the aforementioned genes, which could result in a lower immunogenic/toxic potential, could be of great importance in breeding programs. For this purpose, we screened a collection of tetraploid wheat genotypes for allelic variants of annotated gliadin genes in the durum wheat genome, in order to identify genetic resources available to breeders to improve wheat nutritional and technological properties. Phylogenetic analysis among different species of Triticum genus and an in silico expression data analysis may also be useful in the exploitation of the complex scenario of gliadin–glutenin interaction and gluten role in the adverse reactions due to wheat consumption.
'System reliability optimization: A fuzzy multi-objective genetic algorithm approach. System reliability optimization is often faced with imprecise and conflicting goals such as reducing the cost of the system and improving the reliability of the system. The decision making process becomes fuzzy and multi-objective. In this paper, we formulate the problem as a fuzzy multi-objective nonlinear program. A fuzzy multi-objective genetic algorithm approach (FMGA) is proposed for solving the multi-objective decision problem in order to handle the fuzzy goals and constraints. The approach is able flexible and adaptable, allowing for intermediate solutions, leading to high quality solutions. Thus, the approach incorporates the preferences of the decision maker concerning the cost and reliability goals through the use of fuzzy numbers. The utility of the approach is demonstrated on benchmark problems in the literature. Computational results show that the FMGA approach is promising.
Mechanisms of selenium hyperaccumulation in plants: A survey of molecular, biochemical and ecological cues. Background: Selenium (Se) is a micronutrient required for many life forms, but toxic at higher concentration. Plants do not have a Se requirement, but can benefit from Se via enhanced antioxidant activity. Some plant species can accumulate Se to concentrations above 0.1% of dry weight and seem to possess mechanisms that distinguish Se from its analog sulfur (S). Research on these so-called Se hyperaccumulators aims to identify key genes for this remarkable trait and to understand ecological implications. Scope of review: This review gives a broad overview of the current knowledge about Se uptake and metabolism in plants, with a special emphasis on hypothesized mechanisms of Se hyperaccumulation. The role of Se in plant defense responses and the associated ecological implications are discussed. Major conclusions: Hyperaccumulators have enhanced expression of S transport and assimilation genes, and may possess transporters with higher specificity for selenate over sulfate. Genes involved in antioxidant reactions and biotic stress resistance are also upregulated. Key regulators in these processes appear to be the growth regulators jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and ethylene. Hyperaccumulation may have evolved owing to associated ecological benefits, particularly protection against pathogens and herbivores, and as a form of elemental allelopathy. General significance: Understanding plant Se uptake and metabolism in hyperaccumulators has broad relevance for the environment, agriculture and human and animal nutrition and may help generate crops with selenate-specific uptake and high capacity to convert selenate to less toxic, anticarcinogenic, organic Se compounds.
Using genetic algorithms to optimise current and future health planning - the example of ambulance locations. Background: Ambulance response time is a crucial factor in patient survival. The number of emergency cases (EMS cases) requiring an ambulance is increasing due to changes in population demographics. This is decreasing ambulance response times to the emergency scene. This paper predicts EMS cases for 5-year intervals from 2020, to 2050 by correlating current EMS cases with demographic factors at the level of the census area and predicted population changes. It then applies a modified grouping genetic algorithm to compare current and future optimal locations and numbers of ambulances. Sets of potential locations were evaluated in terms of the (current and predicted) EMS case distances to those locations.Results: Future EMS demands were predicted to increase by 2030 using the model (R2 = 0.71). The optimal locations of ambulances based on future EMS cases were compared with current locations and with optimal locations modelled on current EMS case data. Optimising the location of ambulance stations locations reduced the average response times by 57 seconds. Current and predicted future EMS demand at modelled locations were calculated and compared.Conclusions: The reallocation of ambulances to optimal locations improved response times and could contribute to higher survival rates from life-threatening medical events. Modelling EMS case 'demand' over census areas allows the data to be correlated to population characteristics and optimal 'supply' locations to be identified. Comparing current and future optimal scenarios allows more nuanced planning decisions to be made. This is a generic methodology that could be used to provide evidence in support of public health planning and decision making.
Clostridium difficile clade 3 (RT023) have a modified cell surface and contain a large transposable island with novel cargo. The major global pathogen Clostridium difficile (recently renamed Clostridioides difficile) has large genetic diversity including multiple mobile genetic elements. In this study, whole genome sequencing of 86 strains from the poorly characterised clade 3, predominantly PCR ribotype (RT)023, of C. difficile revealed distinctive surface architecture characteristics and a large mobile genetic island. These strains have a unique sortase substrate phenotype compared with well-characterised strains of C. difficile, and loss of the phage protection protein CwpV. A large genetic insertion (023_CTnT) comprised of three smaller elements (023_CTn1-3) is present in 80/86 strains analysed in this study, with genes common among other bacterial strains in the gut microbiome. Novel cargo regions of 023_CTnT include genes encoding a sortase, putative sortase substrates, lantibiotic ABC transporters and a putative siderophore biosynthetic cluster. We demonstrate the excision of 023_CTnT and sub-elements 023_CTn2 and 023_CTn3 from the genome of RT023 reference strain CD305 and the transfer of 023_CTn3 to a non-toxigenic C. difficile strain, which may have implications for the use of non-toxigenic C. difficile strains as live attenuated vaccines. Finally, we show that the genes within the island are expressed in a regulated manner in C. difficile RT023 strains conferring a distinct “niche adaptation”.
A 21st century reproductive bioethocs. Since its beginnings Bioethical analyses and debates have been mostly aimed at discussing the permissibility of new practices such as New Reproductive Technologies (NRTs). NRTs are no longer "new": They are part of human ordinary life and contribute to human flourishing, allowing people to build families that could have not been built otherwise. Bioethics should take this fact into account and modify its agenda accordingly. NRTs should be regarded not as a matter of "Frontiers Bioethics"but rather of "Everyday Bioethics"even when genetic interventions aimed at "choosing"the identities of future people are at stake. A 21st Century Reproductive Bioethics should be focused on how to improve the right of every human being to access NRTs and not on a general discussion about their permissibility.
Sequences of initiator and elongator methionine tRNAs in bean mitochondria - Localization of the corresponding genes on maize and wheat mitochondrial genomes. Two bean mitochondria methionine transfer RNAs, purified by RPC-5 chromatography and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, have been sequenced using in vitro post-labeling techniques. One of these tRNAsMet has been identified by formylation using an E. coli enzyme as the mitochondrial tRNAFMet. It displays strong structural homologies with prokaryotic and chloroplast tRNAFMet sequences (70.1-83.1%) and with putative initiator tRNAmMet genes described for wheat, maize and Oenothera mitochondrial genomes (88.3-89.6%). The other tRNAMet, which is the mitochondrial elongator tRNAFMet, shows a high degree of sequence homology (93.3-96%& with chloroplast tRNAmMet, but a weak homology (40.7%) with a sequenced maize mitochondrial putative elongator tRNAmMet gene. Bean mitochondrial tRNAFMet and tRNAmMet were hybridized to Southern blots of the mitochondrial genomes of wheat and maize, whose maps have been recently published (15, 22), in order to locate the position of their genes.
Evaluating Microsatellite Markers for Parentage-Based Tagging of Hatchery Burbot. Concerned stakeholders in various nations are investigating stock enhancement with hatchery supplementation as one of several strategies to restore imperiled burbot (Lota lota L.) populations. In other intensively studied species, the use of genetic markers for parentage-based tagging (PBT) has become an important tool for evaluating the ecology of hatchery-wild fish interactions. Our objective was to determine if microsatellites previously developed for studies of burbot phylogeography could be multiplexed for effective PBT. A total of 14 microsatellite loci were multiplexed in four panels and tested for PBT efficacy in a hatchery population of burbot. An exclusion-based test involving 123 anonymous offspring and 51 known parent-pairs resulted in 97% of the progeny assigning to the correct parents. Due to modest genetic diversity in the broodstock population, a high false-assignment rate (19%) was observed when parental cross information was excluded from parentage analyses. While the existing set of burbot microsatellites can be multiplexed into effective panels for PBT, we recommend the development of additional microsatellite or single nucleotide polymorphism markers to improve exclusionary power.
G-banding of the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus and the striped grass mouse Lemniscomys barbarus (Rodentia, Muridae) from Tunisia. In Tunisia the Muridae family is represented by 18 species and in the present study we focus on two of them: the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus and the striped grass mouse Lemniscomys barbarus. These two species are found in the North of the country in forests (for A. sylvaticus) and cultivated lands (for L. barbarus) where humid conditions and food supply are suitable for their development. The G-banding technique applied for the first time in Tunisia on these two species showed that the main difference between our results and the previous studies focuses on the sex chromosomes that have clearer G-bands. Although the polymorphism of sex chromosome is relatively rare, it has been reported before as in the case of the genus Microtus, the results we found could be confirmed through DNA analysis.
Proteomic and bioinformatic analysis of the root-knot nematode meloidogyne hapla: The basis for plant parasitism. On the basis of the complete genome sequence of the root-knot nematode Melodogyne hapla, we have deduced and annotated the entire proteome of this plant-parasite to create a database of 14420 proteins. We have made this database, termed HapPep3, available from the Superfamily repository of model organism proteomes (). To experimentally confirm the HapPep3 assignments using proteomics, we applied a data-independent LC/MSE analysis to M. hapla protein extracts fractionated by SDS-PAGE. A total of 516 nonredundant proteins were identified with an average of 9 unique peptides detected per protein. Some proteins, including examples with complex gene organization, were defined by more than 20 unique peptide matches, thus, providing experimental confirmation of computational predictions of intron/exon structures. On the basis of comparisons of the broad physicochemical properties of the experimental and computational proteomes, we conclude that the identified proteins reflect a true and unbiased sampling of HapPep3. Conversely, HapPep3 appears to broadly cover the protein space able to be experimentally sampled. To estimate the false discovery rate, we queried human, plant, and bacterial databases for matches to the LC/MS E-derived peptides, revealing fewer than 1% of matches, most of which were to highly conserved proteins. To provide a functional comparison of the acquired and deduced proteomes, each was subjected to higher order annotation, including comparisons of Gene Ontology, protein domains, signaling, and localization predictions, further indicating concordance, although those proteins that did deviate seem to be highly significant. Approximately 20% of the experimentally sampled proteome was predicted to be secreted, and thus potentially play a role at the host-parasite interface. We examined reference pathways to determine the extent of proteome similarity of M. hapla to that of the free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, revealing significant similarities and differences. Collectively, the analyzed protein set provides an initial foundation to experimentally dissect the basis of plant parasitism by M. hapla.
Partial melting of subducted continental crust: Geochemical evidence from synexhumation granite in the Sulu orogen. The partial melting of crustal rocks is a fundamental mechanism for the emplacement of continental granites. However, difficulty can be encountered in building a direct petrogenetic link between a granite and its source region. Partial melting of deeply subducted continental crust is increasingly being recognized in collisional orogens, but it is unclear whether such a process can produce a considerable volume of granitic melts leading to pluton emplacement. A possible solution to these two problems is to find a direct source-product relationship in granite petrogenesis. Here, we present a combined study of zircon U-Pb ages, Lu-Hf and O isotopes, and whole-rock major and trace elements and Sr-Nd isotopes for a newly found granitic intrusion in the Sulu orogen, China. The results provide geochemical evidence for the partial melting of deeply subducted continental crust during collisional orogenesis. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) zircon U-Pb dating yielded Late Triassic ages of 216 ± 2 Ma to 218 ± 3 Ma, postdating Middle Triassic ages for the ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphism of country rocks, corresponding to synexhumation mag-matism during continental collision. Relict zircon cores have concordant Neoproterozoic and Middle Triassic U-Pb ages, respectively, consistent with protolith and metamorphic ages for the UHP meta-igneous rocks in the Dabie-Sulu orogenic belt. The granite zircons exhibit low d18O values of 1.10‰– 4.32‰, comparable to those of the UHP meta- igneous rocks. The granite is high-K calc-alkaline to shoshonitic and shows trace-element distribution patterns with enrichment in large ion lithophile elements and light rare earth elements but depletion in high field strength elements, consistent with arc-type igneous rocks. Granites have high (87Sr/86Sr)i ratios of 0.7478–0.9709 and negative eNd(t) values of -12.9 to -7.8, with two-stage Nd model ages of 1.93–2.28 Ga for whole rock. Zircon Lu-Hf isotope analyses also yield negative eHf(t) values of -17.8 to -5.9 with two-stage Hf model ages of 1.62– 2.37 Ga. These whole-rock and zircon geo-chemical characteristics are generally comparable with those of the UHP meta-igneous rocks, indicating a genetic link between them. In particular, the low d18O values and the zircon relicts of Neoproterozoic and Tri-assic U-Pb ages are characteristic features of the subducted continental crust of the South China block. Therefore, the granite was derived from decompressional melting of the subducted upper continental crust during exhumation. The granitic melts produced in this stage may serve as metasomatic agents for crust-mantle interaction in the continental subduction channel. This provides a direct candidate for the crustal component in the mantle source of postcollisional mafic igneous rocks.
Analysis of protein profiles of genetically modified potato tubers by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Traceability of genetically modified (GM) foods demands the development of appropriate reliable techniques in order to identify and quantify peptide or nucleic acid residues in GM plants and food products through the food chain. In this study the applicability of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) was demonstrated for the characterization of proteins of transformed and untransformed potato (Solanum Tuberosum L.) tubers. In GM tubers the expression level of the G1-1 gene, which regulates transition from dormancy to sprouting tubers, was inhibited by antisense technology. The analysis of antisense transformed lines showed that several of them exhibited a significant delay in sprouting relative to the control lines, in accordance with a decrease in the transcript level. Preliminary attempts to compare the protein patterns obtained from transformed and control lines using traditional electrophoresis were not able to reveal differences in the low-kDa range. Instead, MALDI-TOFMS applied to total peptide extract without any purification was able to distinguish spectral patterns of transformed and untransformed lines. In particular, several characteristic peaks from m/z 4373 to 4932 were detected only in the mass spectra of GM tuber samples.
Cloning the Switch: Digital and Markov Representations. The lysis-lysogeny switch in E. coli due to infection from lambda phage has been extensively studied and explained by scientists of molecular biology. The bacterium either survives with the viral strand of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or dies producing hundreds of viruses for propagation of infection. Many proteins transcribed after infection by \\lambda phage take part in determining the fate of the bacterium, but two proteins that play a key role in this regard are the cI and cro dimers, which are transcribed off the viral DNA. This paper presents a novel modeling mechanism for the lysis-lysogeny switch, by transferring the interactions of the main proteins, the lambda right operator and promoter regions and the ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase, to a finite state machine (FSM), to determine cell fate. The FSM, and thus derived is implemented in field-programmable gate array (FPGA), and simulations have been run in random conditions. A Markov model has been created for the same mechanism. Steady state analysis has been conducted for the transition matrix of the Markov model, and the results have been generated to show the steady state probability of lysis with various model values. In this paper, it is hoped to lay down guidelines to convert biological processes into computing machines.
Biased distributions and decay of long interspersed nuclear elements in the chicken genome. The genomes of birds are much smaller than mammalian genomes, and transposable elements (TEs) make up only 10% of the chicken genome, compared with the 45% of the human genome. To study the mechanisms that constrain the copy numbers of TEs, and as a consequence the genome size of birds, we analyzed the distributions of LINEs (CR1's) and SINEs (MIRs) on the chicken autosomes and Z chromosome. We show that (1) CR1 repeats are longest on the Z chromosome and their length is negatively correlated with the local GC content; (2) the decay of CR1 elements is highly biased, and the 5′ ends of the insertions are lost much faster than their 3′-ends; (3) the GC distribution of CR1 repeats shows a bimodal pattern with repeats enriched in both AT-rich and GC-rich regions of the genome, but the CR1 families show large differences in their GC distribution; and (4) the few MIRs in the chicken are most abundant in regions with intermediate GC content. Our results indicate that the primary mechanism that removes repeats from the chicken genome is ectopic exchange and that the low abundance of repeats in avian genomes is likely to be the consequence of their high recombination rates.
The complete nucleotide sequence of white Amur bream (Parabramis pekinensis) mitochondrial genome. White Amur bream, Parabramis pekinensis (Cypriniformes: Cyprinidae), a freshwater cyprinid fish, is an important economic fish in several countries, especially in China. The complete sequence of P. pekinensis mitochondrial genome has been determined. The genome is 16,622 bp in length, and consists of 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes and the noncoding control region, with the genomic organization being identical to that of typical vertebrates. Three conserved sequence blocks (CSB1 to CSB3) were identified in the control region. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence is useful for phylogenetic analysis and studies of population genetics of P. pekinensis.
Quasielastic light scattering by biopolymers. Center-of-mass motion of DNA in the presence of a sinusoidal electric field. Quasielastic light scattering is now a well-established technique for rapid determination of diffusion coefficients from the spectral density of Rayleigh scattered light. Application of a constant electric field in the course of a quasielastic light scattering experiment, a technique termed electrophoretic light scattering (ELS), results in a series of peaks that are Doppler shifted by an amount proportional to the superimposed instantaneous velocity of the molecules. Electrophoretic mobilities, diffusion coefficients, and relative concentrations of each component in a polydispersed system can be determined from a single ELS experiment. A theory for polymer dynamics in the presence of an applied sinusoidal field has also been proposed. The present communication presents data in which the center-of-mass of DNA is studied in the presence of a low frequency sinusoidal field. It is shown that: (1) at very low frequencies the power spectrum is composed of several peaks Doppler shifted by an amount proportional to the driving frequency ω (i.e. fundamental and harmonic overtones); (2) the peak amplitude of the fundamental frequency shift is proportionall to 1/ω in accordance with the theory. The advantage of using a sinusoidal applied field instead of a pulsed square-wave is discussed.
Expression from the Escherichia coli dapA promoter is regulated by intracellular levels of diaminopimelic acid. Dihydropicolinate synthase (DHDPS; E.C. 4.2.1.52) catalyses the first committed step of lysine biosynthesis in plants and bacteria. Plant DHDPS enzymes, which are responsible solely for lysine biosynthesis, are strongly inhibited by lysine (I0.5=10μM), whereas the bacterial enzymes which are less responsive or insensitive to lysine inhibition have the additional function of meso-diaminopimelate biosynthesis which is required for cell wall formation. Previous studies have suggested that expression of the Escherichia coli dapA gene, encoding DHDPS, is unregulated. We show here that this is not the case and that expression of LacZ from the dapA promoter (P dapA) increases in response to diaminopimelic acid limitation in E. coli K-12.
Characterization of ovine monocyte activity when cultured with Haemonchus contortus larvae in vitro. Aims: The objective of this study was to identify and characterize cell populations within ovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) associated with Haemonchus contortus (Hc) larval morbidity and impairment in vitro. Methods and results: Monocytes and lymphocytes were separated from PBMC from parasite-resistant St. Croix (STC) sheep and parasite-susceptible Suffolk (SUF) sheep. Cells were cultured with Hc third stage larvae (L3) for 9\xa0h. Larval morbidity was assessed using ATP concentration. Activation status was determined through gene expression analysis and enzyme inhibition. Enzymes arginase-1 (Arg1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were inhibited using BEC (S-(2-boronoethyl)-I-cysteine) and 1400W (N-(3-(aminomethyl)benzyl)acetamidine), respectively. Larval ATP was lower when cultured with STC-derived monocytes (0.015\xa0μmol/L ATP) compared to SUF-derived monocytes (0.067\xa0μmol/L ATP) (P\xa0<.001), or lymphocytes from either breed (STC: 0.085\xa0μmol/L, SUF: 0.112\xa0μmol/L ATP) (P\xa0<.001). SUF-derived monocytes displayed higher expression of M1 genes, whereas STC-derived monocytes displayed M2 genes continuously. Inhibition of Arg1 decreased monocyte function in both breeds, whereas iNOS inhibition restored SUF-derived monocyte function. Conclusions: Together, these data indicate STC-derived monocytes favour M2 phenotype when exposed to L3, where SUF-derived monocyte function resembled M1 phenotype and described potential for improving Suffolk sheep through modulating inflammatory responses.
A genetic assay for the detection of aneuploidy in the germ-line cells of Drosophila melanogaster. A 2-generation assay is described for the detection of aneuploidy in the germ-line cells of Drosophila melanogaster. Larvae and adult females that carry marker mutations are exposed to test compounds, and the F2 generation is scored for exceptional phenotypes. As a consequence of nondisjunction and/or loss of the sex chromosomes, 5 exceptional phenotypes appear. These phenotypes are often indicative of specific types of nondisjunction. Based on the time course and the pattern of exception production of the treated parents, aneuploidy due to meiotic and mitotic defects can be separated. The genetic analysis of the exceptions reveals whether nondisjunction has occurred due to failure of the spindle fibres to disjoin chromosomes or attachment of the chromosomes. The described assay is an extension of the so-called Somatic Mutation and Recombination Test (SMART) and allows screening for different genetic endpoints: aneuploidy, recombinogenic and mutagenic activities in the same treatment. The effects of colchicine and EMS are described with respect to the induction of (i) aneuploidy in the germ line and (ii) somatic mutation and recombination in the eyes, wings and female germ-line cells. Colchicine induces aneuploidy in the germ-line cells while the frequency of mosaic spots does not increase after colchicine treatment. This result suggest that aneuploidy plays little (if any) role in the formation of mosaic spots. Colchicine induces nondisjunction in the mitotically rather than in the meiotically dividing germ-line cells. EMS, as expected, induces high frequency of somatic mutation and recombination but not aneuploidy in the female germ line.
Detection of filaria-specific IgG4 antibodies and filarial DNA, for the screening of blood spots for Brugia timori. The establishment of simple, sensitive and specific tools for the diagnosis of brugian lymphatic filariasis is a prerequisite for a successful intervention to control the disease. In the simple and rapid Brugia Rapid (BR) test, an immunochromatographic dipstick is used to detect IgG4 antibodies that are reactive with a recombinant Brugia malayi antigen. When sera from 109 individuals with Brugia microfilaraemias (12 with B. malayi and 97 with B. timori) were investigated using the BR test, all were found positive. In contrast, all of the 150 sera from individuals with Onchocerca volvulus or Mansonella infections investigated were found negative in BR tests. Some unwelcome cross-reactions were observed, however, with sera from individuals infected with Wuchereria bancrofti (three of 12 test-positive) and Dirofilaria (one of nine test-positive). In an attempt to facilitate sample collection and detect any cross-reactions, the BR dipstick was used to screen blood spots, that had been allowed to dry on filter paper, for B. timori microfilariae, before the dipstick-positive samples were tested with a PCR-based assay. Of the 66 individuals so tested, 37 (56%) were found positive by the BR test used on dry blood spots and eight (22%) by the filtration of fresh blood samples. Only nine of the 37 dipstick-positive samples were found PCR-positive. The combined use of BR tests and PCR-based assays, for testing blood spots in areas where brugian filariasis is endemic, appears to be a promising method not only for post-treatment monitoring but also for the certification activities planned within the framework of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis.
The winners: species that have benefited from 30 years of conservation action. New Zealand is a world leader in saving species from the brink of extinction. We selected seven case studies to explore successful species conservation in New Zealand over the past 30 years to exemplify what makes a ‘conservation winner’. The taxa chosen were: Hebe armstrongii, Mercury Islands tusked wētā, Galaxias vulgaris, tuatara, saddleback, long-tailed bat and humpback whale. Three of the case studies (hebe, wētā, galaxiids) illustrate the lack of attention compared to birds, possibly limiting conservation achievements. Considerable attention has gone into the development of species-specific techniques, including captive breeding and translocation protocols, and genetic studies to define management units. All case studies demonstrated the need for continued conservation attention, as long-term success is not guaranteed. We believe by accentuating the positive outcomes of conservation, the wider community will realise that efforts to save endangered species have the potential to reverse the current extinction crisis facing the world.
Synergism between CACGTG (G‐box) and CACCTG cis‐elements is required for activation of the bean seed storage protein β‐phaseolin} gene. Expression of bean seed storage protein phaseolin is under strict developmental control. Four distinct nuclear proteins recognize in vitro the proximal, β‐phaseolin} promoter (−295/+45) which confers spatial and temporal regulation of the native gene. Functional significance of these protein‐binding sites was evaluated by substitution mutation of the motifs in the promoter, which was fused to GUS reporter gene, and subsequent transient gene expression assay using protoplasts from developing bean cotyledons. DNA‐binding protein CAN binds three CANNTG motifs, CACGTG (−248/−243), CACCTG (−163/−158), and CATATG (−100/−95). Substitution mutation of the CACGTG motif, which is commonly known as G‐box, reduced the −295 promoter activity by 75%, indicating that the G‐box is a major positive cis‐element. Mutation analyses also demonstrated that the CACCTG and CATATG motifs act as positive and negative cis‐elements, respectively. Substitution mutation of all three CANNTG motifs essentially eliminated the −295 promoter activity. A construct containing the G‐box and CACCTG motif resulted in a transcriptional level that is much greater than the sum of the transcriptional levels from the individual cis‐elements, demonstrating that the G‐box and CACCTG act synergistically. Substitution mutations of two AT‐rich sequences, to which a nuclear protein AG‐1 binds, showed that these sites function as major negative (−376/−367, −356/−347) or positive (−191/−182) cis‐elements, and that the effect of the two AG‐1 binding sites was counteractive in the −391 promoter. These results indicate that the three CANNTG motifs and two AG‐1‐binding sites play critical roles in transcription of the {β‐phaseolin} gene in cotyledons.
Development and screening of EMS mutants with altered seed oil content or fatty acid composition in Brassica napus. Brassica napus is an important oilseed crop in the world, and the mechanism of seed oil biosynthesis in B. napus remains unclear. In order to study the mechanism of oil biosynthesis and generate germplasms for breeding, an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutant population with ~100\xa0000 M2 lines was generated using Zhongshuang 11 as the parent line. The EMS-induced genome-wide mutations in M2−M4 plants were assessed. The average number of mutations including single nucleotide polymorphisms and insertion/deletion in M2−M4 was 21\xa0177, 28\xa0675 and 17\xa0915, respectively. The effects of the mutations on gene function were predicted in M2−M4 mutants, respectively. We screened the seeds from 98\xa0113 M2 lines, and 9415 seed oil content and fatty acid mutants were identified. We further confirmed 686 mutants with altered seed oil content and fatty acid in advanced generation (M4 seeds). Five representative M4 mutants with increased oleic acid were re-sequenced, and the potential causal variations in FAD2 and ROD1 genes were identified. This study generated and screened a large scale of B. napus EMS mutant population, and the identified mutants could provide useful genetic resources for the study of oil biosynthesis and genetic improvement of seed oil content and fatty acid composition of B. napus in the future.
Simultaneous identification of two MspI polymorphisms of the porcine myogenin gene in Hungarian breeds. Simultaneous analysis of two myogenin (MYOG) loci has been carried out using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) tests in DNA isolated from blood samples collected from four different pig breeds (Hungarian Large White, Duroc, Mangalica and Hungarian Landrace). The following MYOGA frequency values have been obtained: Hungarian Large White 0.2416; Duroc 0.0900; Mangalica 0.6617; Hungarian Landrace 0.2361. The MYOG2 allele was found in Duroc and Mangalica breeds only. This test allows the analysis of two loci of the MYOG gene in parallel, which might be used in marker assisted selection programmes in the near future. Ongoing studies on the possible effects of the MYOG types on carcass and growth traits are outlined.
Shallow-water reef ophiuroids (Echinodermata: Ophiuroidea) of Réunion (Mascarene Islands), with biogeographic considerations. Despite their importance in marine biodiversity, invertebrates are far less studied than vertebrates. Given the current global biodiversity crisis and insufficient taxonomic resources, sustained efforts need to be undertaken to assess species diversity, especially in the highly threatened 'biodiversity hotspots'. Réunion is a young volcanic island lying in the Mascarene Islands (south-western Indian Ocean, SWIO), a marine biodiversity hotspot. A substantial sampling effort was conducted around Réunion Island to document shallow water reef-associated ophiuroid (brittle-stars) diversity, a class recognised as the most diverse among echinoderms. A total of 33 species were documented, increasing the known species richness of the island by 56%. Findings include 15 new records for Réunion, 11 for the Mascarene Islands and 8 for the Indian Ocean. The most diverse family was Ophiocomidae, a family of large, abundant and conspicuous tropical species. Even in this well studied family, a new species was revealed by this survey. Morphological variants together with DNA sequence variations within several species revealed cryptic species. We compared our results with the known fauna of other Mascarene Islands and discuss biogeographic implications for the region.
Characterisation of the Escherichia coli mfd promoter. The bacterial mfd gene encodes a transcription-repair coupling factor that mediates the preferential repair of DNA damage in the template strand of active transcriptional units. In this report, the transcription start site for the Escherichia coli mfd gene was determined in vivo and in vitro, and the DNA determinants for mfd transcription by deletion and site-directed mutagenesis were defined. A canonical σ70-dependent promoter, mfd P1, was responsible for the majority of mfd transcription, and a core region consisting of residues -42 to +5 was sufficient for full activity in rich and minimal media.
Characterization of a novel organic solute transporter homologue from Clonorchis sinensis. Clonorchis sinensis is a liver fluke that can dwell in the bile ducts of mammals. Bile acid transporters function to maintain the homeostasis of bile acids in C. sinensis, as they induce physiological changes or have harmful effects on C. sinensis survival. The organic solute transporter (OST) transports mainly bile acid and belongs to the SLC51 subfamily of solute carrier transporters. OST plays a critical role in the recirculation of bile acids in higher animals. In this study, we cloned full-length cDNA of the 480- amino acid OST from C. sinensis (CsOST). Genomic analysis revealed 11 exons and nine introns. The CsOST protein had a ‘Solute_trans_a’ domain with 67% homology to Schistosoma japonicum OST. For further analysis, the CsOST protein sequence was split into the ordered domain (CsOST-N) at the N-terminus and disordered domain (CsOST-C) at the C-terminus. The tertiary structure of each domain was built using a threading-based method and determined by manual comparison. In a phylogenetic tree, the CsOST-N domain belonged to the OSTα and CsOST-C to the OSTβ clade. These two domains were more highly conserved with the OST α- and β-subunits at the structure level than at sequence level. These findings suggested that CsOST comprised the OSTα- and β-subunits. CsOST was localized in the oral and ventral suckers and in the mesenchymal tissues abundant around the intestine, vitelline glands, uterus, and testes. This study provides fundamental data for the further understanding of homologues in other flukes.
PCR detection and 16S rRNA sequence-based phylogeny of a novel Propionibacterium acidipropionici applicable for enhanced fermentation of high moisture corn. Aims: The aims of this study were to develop a sensitive and more rapid detection of Propionibacterium acidipropionici DH42 in silage and rumen fluid samples, and to explore its 16S rRNA sequence-based phylogeny. Methods and Results: Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used with DH42-specific primers dhb1 and dhb2 for the secondary amplification of a 1267-bp fragment of 16S rRNA encoding gene. Using the established protocols for PCR amplification, as low as 102 and 103 CFU ml-1 of strain DH42 in silage extracts and rumen fluid, respectively, were detected. To determine phylogenetic relationships between DH42 and other representatives of Propionibacterineae, a 1529-bp fragment of its 16S rRNA was amplified by PCR and sequenced. The propionibacterium DH42 formed a cluster with Eubacterium combesii, P. acidipropionici and P. microaerophilus. Conclusions: 16S rRNA-based PCR detection technique was developed for DH42 in silage and rumen fluid samples. The 16S rRNA sequence confirmed the earlier identification of strain DH42 as P. acidipropionici. However, variable nucleotide positions were revealed. Significance and Impact of the Study: Variability of 16S rRNA sequence within the species P. acidipropionici, determined in this study, poses the need of re-sequencing for some species of the suborder Propionibacterineae for a more reliable classification.
Combination processes of diamond recovery from metasomatically altered kimberlite rocks. The article gives new experimental data on chemistry, phase composition, structure and physicochemical properties of surface of minerals composing metasomatically altered kimberlite rocks. The authors have determined formation conditions and basic genetic types of mineral micro- and nano-size phases on diamond surface in the form of aluminosilicate minerals, thin coats of clayey minerals, calcite and dolomite bound with carbonate cement, as well as their negative effect on recovery of diamonds by foam separation. The mechanisms and efficient methods of combined energy effects on the natural heterogeneous system of diamond and surface mineral phase are found to rupture hydrophilic mineral films on diamond surface, prevent their repeated formation and reduce diamond loss in processing of diamond-bearing kimberlites.
Studies on relationship between seed yield and yield components in Soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill). A study was conducted on 56 genotypes of soybean to determine correlation and per cent contribution of variation by each trait on grain yield through principal component analysis. Mean Values for traits studied showed that TGx1987-64F had the highest yield of 2.09 t/ha, followed by TGx 1987-37-37F. Correlation coefficient for seed yield was positive with days to flowering and maturity, plant height and number of pods per plant. The principal component analysis identified the traits days to maturity, plant height and number of pods per plan as mostly responsible for variation among the genotypes. Highly weighted variables under the first principal component which explained 39.83% of the total variation include days to maturity, plant height and number of pods per plant. The second principal component explained an additional 20.52% of the total variation. These two components explained 60.36% of the total variation in all the variables. Therefore, genetic enhancement of these traits will ultimately increase the grain yield.
Environmental stratification and performance of coffea canephora clones grown in the western amazon. Change in the performance of clones grown in different environments is an important question for Coffea canephora breeding. The aim of this study was to evaluate environmental stratification and the performance of C. canephora clones grown in the Western Amazon. For that purpose, the mean yield of three crop seasons was considered to evaluate the performance of 20 genotypes grown in 6 clonal competition trials in the environments of: E1: Ouro Preto do Oeste-RO, E2: Porto Velho-RO, E3: Ariquemes-RO, E4 and E5: Rio Branco-AC and E6: Alta Floresta do Oeste-RO. The trials were conducted with a plant spacing of 3 m × 1.5 m in a complete block experimental design, with three replications of eight plants per plot. Combined analysis indicated significance of the genotype × environment (G×E) interaction and favorable conditions to obtain gains from selection. Reduction in the dimensionality estimated from climate and soil characteristics indicated that the environments of Porto Velho-RO, Rio Branco-AC and Ariquemes-RO are more similar to each other than the environments of Ouro Preto do Oeste-RO and Alta Floresta-RO of greater natural soil fertility and higher altitude. The AMMI1 biplot shows that genotypes 16, 10, and 13 had the highest mean yields, together with greater stability. In the AMMI2 scatterplot (IPCA1×IPCA2), the environments E4 and E5 were clustered in the same sector. Clustering based on the complex fraction of the G×E interaction coincided with the AMMI2 scatterplot that clustered the E4 and E5 environments in a single mega-environment. Except for these environments, all the others clustered as locations of different biotic and abiotic stress conditions. This result shows the importance of maintaining evaluations in these environments, which represent the conditions of the coffee fields in the region.
Complex and reticulate origin of edible roses (Rosa, Rosaceae) in China. While roses are today among the most popular ornamental plants, the petals and fruits of some cultivars have flavored foods for millennia. The genetic origins of these edible cultivars remain poorly investigated. We collected the major varieties of edible roses available in China, assembled their plastome sequences, and phased the haplotypes for internal transcribed spacers (ITS1/ITS2) of the 18S-5.8S-26S nuclear ribosomal cistron. Our phylogenetic reconstruction using 88 plastid genomes, of primarily maternal origin, uncovered well-supported genetic relationships within Rosa, including all sections and all subgenera. We phased the ITS sequences to identify potential donor species ancestral to the development of known edible cultivars. The tri-parental Middle-Eastern origin of R. × damascena, the species most widely used in perfume products and food additives, was confirmed as a descendent of past hybridizations among R. moschata, R. gallica, and R. majalis/R. fedtschenkoana/R. davurica. In contrast, R. chinensis, R. rugosa, and R. gallica, in association with six other wild species, were the main donors for fifteen varieties of edible roses. The domesticated R. rugosa 'Plena' was shown to be a hybrid between R. rugosa and R. davurica, sharing a common origin with R. 'Fenghua'. Only R. 'Jinbian' and R. 'Crimson Glory' featured continuous flowering. All remaining cultivars of edible roses bloomed only once a year. Our study provides important resources for clarifying the origin of edible roses and suggests a future for breeding new cultivars with unique traits, such as continuous flowering.
Synergistic activity of fosfomycin-meropenem and fosfomycin-colistin against carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae : An in vitro evidence. Aim: To evaluate the antibacterial activity of fosfomycin-meropenem and fosfomycin-colistin combinations against carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-Kp). Methods: A total of 50 CR-Kp isolates recovered from blood cultures were included in this study. All the CR-Kp isolates were screened for the presence of carbapenem resistant genes blaIMP, blaVIM, blaNDM, blaOXA-48 like, blaKPC, blaGES and blaSPM. Combination testing of fosfomycin-meropenem and fosfomycin-colistin were performed using time-kill assay. Results: Fosfomycin-meropenem combination showed synergy in 20% of the tested CR-Kp isolates.While, fosfomycin-colistin exhibited synergy against 16% of the isolates. A total of 68% (n = 34) of CR-Kp isolates were characterised as OXA-48-like producers and 22% (n = 11) as NDM producers. Synergistic activity of these combinations was observed against OXA-48, NDM and NDM + OXA-48 co-producers. Conclusion: Considerable synergistic antibacterial activity of fosfomycin-meropenem and fosfomycin-colistin was not observed against CR-Kp isolates. Therefore, these combinations may not be promising for infections associated with CR-Kp. Lay abstract: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-Kp) infections are difficult to treat and are associated with a high mortality rate. This study aimed to evaluate the synergistic activity of fosfomycin-meropenem and fosfomycin-colistin combinations against CR-Kp. Synergistic activity of these combinations was observed against OXA-48, NDM and NDM + OXA-48 co-producers. However, synergism was not found to be significant. Therefore, these combinations may not be promising for infections associated with CR-Kp.
Primary structure from amino acid and cDNA sequences of two Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase variants from Xenopus laevis. A mixture of two different amino acid sequences was discovered in Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase purified from the amphibian Xenopus laevis. No N-terminal post-translational modification was found. The high number of substitutions in the sequence suggested that protein heterogeneity was a product of gene duplication. This was confirmed by isolation of two different cDNA clones. Nucleotide sequence analysis allowed the primary structure of the two peptide chains to be unambiguously assigned. The observed changes (19 in 150 residues) are distributed along the peptide chain to give similar protein net charges although substitutions of the same polarity and/or charge were the exception rather than the rule. The degree of diversity between the two Xenopus variants is comparable to that between mammalian sequences and shows that the putative increase of the rate of mutation for Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase at later evolution stages (Y. M. Lee , 1985, Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 241, 577-589; G. J. Steffens , 1986, Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler 367, 1017-1024) is observed in amphibians. This is the first time complete sequences for Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase variants from the same organism have been found to be products of divergent genes and not simply allelic mutations.
Isolation-by-environment as a driver of genetic differentiation among populations of the only broad-leaved evergreen shrub Ammopiptanthus mongolicus in Asian temperate deserts. Whether the effect of migration-selection-drift equilibrium on population structure is governed by spatial or environmental differences is usually elucidated by isolation-by-distance (IBD), isolation-by-environment (IBE), and isolation-by-resistance (IBR) tests. The population structure of Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, a broad-leaved evergreen psammophyte in eastern Central Asia, was previously thought to follow an isolation by distance pattern. However, recent studies have emphasized the effects of environmental factors on its growth and distribution, suggesting an important influence of local adaptation on the genetic structure of the species. Using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers, we verified the previously inferred low intra-population variation and high inter-population differentiation. However, in contrast to previous studies, the results of partial Mantel tests and a maximum likelihood population effects mixed model (MLPE) suggested that local climate differences, rather than geographic distances or resistance distances, are the main factor affecting population differentiation. Further analysis with removal of multicollinear climatic variables and univariate MLPE found that summer and winter precipitation were crucial for shaping the current population genetic structure. Since local precipitation is related to the regeneration, colonization, and overwintering survival of A. mongolicus, its influence on demographic change may explain its effect on the population genetic structure. In addition, precipitation is related to terrain despite westward decreases, which explains the independence of genetic difference and geographic distance. The identified role of IBE suggests that collecting germplasm resources from genetically differentiated populations could be a more effective strategy to preserve the overall genetic diversity of the species than the establishment of corridors to enhance gene flow among populations.
Botryosphaeria species from Eucalyptus in Australia are pleoanamorphic, producing Dichomera synanamorphs in culture. Species within the genus Botryosphaeria include some of the most widespread and important pathogens of woody plants, and have been the focus of numerous taxonomic studies in recent years. It is currently accepted that anamorphs of Botryosphaeria belong to two distinct genera, Fusicoccum and Diplodia. Species within the genus Fusicoccum commonly produce aseptate, hyaline conidia. In the present study, fungi were isolated from foliage and wood of Eucalyptus in native forests and plantations in Australia. Although these fungi produced Dichomera anamorphs in culture, they clustered within the Fusicoccum clade of Botryosphaeria based on their ITS sequence data. Four species, Botryosphaeria dothidea, B. parva, B. ribis and B. australis produced Dichomera conidia in culture. The Dichomera synanamorphs are described for these four species of Botryosphaeria. In addition, falling within the Fusicoccum clade of Botryosphaeria, two species were found to be distinct from previously described Botryosphaeria spp. based on their ITS sequences, but synonymous with D. versiformis and D. eucalypti. These observations are currently unique to isolates from host trees within the genus Eucalyptus in Australia, and the pleoanamorphic nature of these species is discussed.
Networks of causal linkage between eigenmodes characterize behavioral dynamics of caenorhabditis elegans. Behavioral phenotyping of model organisms has played an important role in unravelling the complexities of animal behavior. Techniques for classifying behavior often rely on easily identified changes in posture and motion. However, such approaches are likely to miss complex behaviors that cannot be readily distinguished by eye (e.g., high-dimensional dynamics). To explore this issue, we focus on the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, where behaviors have been extensively recorded and classified. Using a dynamical systems lens, we identify high-dimensional, non-linear causal relationships between four basic shapes that describe worm motion (eigenmodes, also called “eigenworms”). We find relationships between all pairs of eigenmodes, but the timescales of the interactions vary between pairs and across individuals. Using these varying timescales, we create “interaction profiles” to represent an individual’s behavioral dynamics. As desired, these profiles are able to distinguish well-known behavioral states: i.e., the profiles for foraging individuals are distinct from those of individuals exhibiting an escape response. More importantly, we find that interaction profiles can distinguish high dimensional behaviors among divergent mutant strains that were previously classified as phenotypically similar. Specifically, we find it is able to detect phenotypic behavioral differences not previously identified in strains related to dysfunction of hermaphrodite-specific neurons.
Deactivation of gibberellin by 2-oxidation during germination of photoblastic lettuce seeds. Gibberellin (GA) plays an important role in the induction of germination of photoblastic lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Grand Rapids) seeds. We have previously shown that gene expression of a GA 3-oxidase (Ls3h1) increased after a red light treatment, resulting in an increase in the endogenous content of GA1, bioactive GA. Since the metabolism of GAs is also important for determining the endogenous levels of bioactive GAs, cDNAs encoding GA 2-oxidases (LsGA2ox1 and LsGA2ox2, for L. sativa GA 2-oxidase), which catalyze the deactivation of GAs, were isolated from lettuce seeds to investigate the regulation of these genes by light. An expression analysis shows that the mRNA levels of both enzymes was not markedly altered under different light conditions during germination. However, the amount of LsGA2ox2 transcripts was decreased to approximately half the level by red light. This reduction might play a role in the increase in GA1 level by red light in the lettuce seeds.
A survey of pyridoxal 5\'-phosphate-dependent proteins in the gram-positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis. The B6 vitamer pyridoxal 5\'-phosphate (PLP) is a co-factor for proteins and enzymes that are involved in diverse cellular processes. Therefore, PLP is essential for organisms from all kingdoms of life. Here we provide an overview about the PLP-dependent proteins from the Gram-positive soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Since B. subtilis serves as a model system in basic research and as a production host in industry, knowledge about the PLP-dependent proteins could facilitate engineering the bacteria for biotechnological applications. The survey revealed that the majority of the PLP-dependent proteins are involved in metabolic pathways like amino acid biosynthesis and degradation, biosynthesis of antibacterial compounds, utilization of nucleotides as well as in iron and carbon metabolism. Many PLP-dependent proteins participate in de novo synthesis of the co-factors biotin, folate, heme, and NAD+ as well as in cell wall metabolism, tRNA modification, regulation of gene expression, sporulation, and biofilm formation. A surprisingly large group of PLP-dependent proteins (29%) belong to the group of poorly characterized proteins. This review underpins the need to characterize the PLP-dependent proteins of unknown function to fully understand the "PLP-ome" of B. subtilis.
Movement of a hybrid zone between lineages of the Australian glass shrimp (Paratya australiensis). In 1993, a population of freshwater glass shrimp (Paratya australiensis) was translocated from Kilcoy Creek to Branch Creek in the Conondale Range, Queensland. Subsequent genetic analysis revealed that the translocated and resident shrimp belonged to different mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages that were capable of hybridizing. Monitoring of the pools along Branch Creek up until 2002 suggested that the translocated lineage had an advantage in upstream pools and the resident lineage dominated downstream. Differential temperature tolerance and hybridization barriers such as hybrid inviability and mate selection were factors proposed to explain hybrid zone structure. The major objective of this study was to combine nuclear and mtDNA markers to identify the structure of the hybrid zone in 2013 and identify any changes that had occurred since 2002. Specifically, we used genetic data to test for evidence of hybrid zone movement and used the inbreeding coefficient (FIS) to investigate whether mating was random in the contact zone where hybridization barriers could be present. The results revealed that the hybrid zone center has shifted 510 m downstream since 2002. Increased rainfall in the region since 2010 could have facilitated this. Secondly, mating appears significantly nonrandom in the pools where both lineages occur, supporting the existence of partial hybridization barriers. This study reveals a complex and dynamic hybrid zone and exemplifies why multiple temporal studies are necessary to understand hybrid zone structure.
A CURLY LEAF homologue controls both vegetative and reproductive development of tomato plants. The Enhancer of Zeste Polycomb group proteins, which are encoded by a small gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana, participate to the control of plant development. In the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), these proteins are encoded by three genes (SlEZ1,SlEZ2 and SlEZ3) that display specific expression profiles. Using a gene specific RNAi strategy, we demonstrate that repression of SlEZ2 correlates with a general reduction of H3K27me3 levels, indicating that SlEZ2 is part of an active PRC2 complex. Reduction of SlEZ2 gene expression impacts the vegetative development of tomato plants, consistent with SlEZ2 having retained at least some of the functions of the Arabidopsis CURLY LEAF (CLF) protein. Notwithstanding, we observed significant differences between transgenic SlEZ2 RNAi tomato plants and Arabidopsisclf mutants. First, we found that reduced SlEZ2 expression has dramatic effects on tomato fruit development and ripening, functions not described in Arabidopsis for the CLF protein. In addition, repression of SlEZ2 has no significant effect on the flowering time or the control of flower organ identity, in contrast to the Arabidopsisclf mutation. Taken together, our results are consistent with a diversification of the function of CLF orthologues in plants, and indicate that although partly conserved amongst plants, the function of EZ proteins need to be newly investigated for non-model plants because they might have been recruited to specific developmental processes.
IFN-γ increases efficiency of DNA vaccine in protecting ducks against infection. Aim: To detect the effects of DNA vaccines in combination with duck IFN-γ gene on the protection of ducks against duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) infection. Methods: DuIFN-γ cDNA was cloned and expressed in COS-7 cells, and the antiviral activity of DuIFN-γ was detected and neutralized by specific antibodies. Ducks were vaccinated with DHBpreS/S DNA alone or co-immunized with plasmid expressing DuIFN-γ. DuIFN-γ mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from immunized ducks was detected by semi-quantitative competitive RT-PCR. Anti-DHBpreS was titrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). DHBV DNA in sera and liver was detected by Southern blot hybridization, after ducks were challenged with high doses of DHBV. Results: DuIFN-γ expressed by COS-7 was able to protect duck fibroblasts against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection in a dose-dependent fashion, and anti-DuIFN-γ antibodies neutralized the antiviral effects. DuIFN-γ in the supernatant also inhibited the release of DHBV DNA from LMH-D2 cells. When ducks were co-immunized with DNA vaccine expressing DHBpreS/S and DuIFN-γ gene as an adjuvant, the level of DuIFN-γ mRNA in PBMCs was higher than that in ducks vaccinated with DHBpreS/S DNA alone. However, the titer of anti-DHBpreS elicited by DHBpreS/S DNA alone was higher than that co-immunized with DuIFN-γ gene and DHBpreS/S DNA. After being challenged with DHBV at high doses, the load of DHBV in sera dropped faster, and the amount of total DNA and cccDNA in the liver decreased more significantly in the group of ducks co-immunized with DuIFN-γ gene and DHBpreS/S DNA than in other groups. Conclusion: DHBV preS/S DNA vaccine can protect ducks against DHBV infection, DuIFN-γ gene as an immune adjuvant enhances its efficacy.
A novel adapter protein employs a phosphotyrosine binding domain and exceptionally basic N-terminal domains to capture and localize an atypical protein kinase C: Characterization of Caenorhabditis elegans C kinase adapter 1, a protein that avidly binds protein kinase C3. Atypical protein kinase C isoforms (aPKCs) transmit regulatory signals to effector proteins located in the cytoplasm, nucleus, cytoskeleton, and membranes. Mechanisms by which aPKCs encounter and control effector proteins in various microenvironments are poorly understood. By using a protein interaction screen, we discovered two novel proteins that adapt a Caenorhabditis elegans aPKC (PKC3) for specialized (localized) functions; protein kinase C adapter 1 (CKA1, 593 amino acids) and CKA1S (549 amino acids) are derived from a unique mRNA by alternative utilization of two translation initiation codons. CKA1S and CKA1 are routed to the cell periphery by exceptionally basic N-terminal regions that include classical phosphorylation site domains (PSDs). Tethering of PKC3 is mediated by a segment of CKA1 that constitutes a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain. Two aromatic amino acids (Phe175 and Phe 221) are indispensable for creation of a PKC3-binding surface and/or stabilization of CKA1·aPKC complexes. Patterns of CKA1 gene promoter activity and CKA1/CKA1S protein localization in vivo overlap with patterns established for PKC3 expression and distribution. Transfection experiments demonstrated that CKA1/CKA1S sequesters PKC3 in intact cells. Structural information in CKA1/CKA1S enables delivery of adapters to the lateral plasma membrane surface (near tight junctions) in polarized epithelial cells. Thus, a PTB domain and PSDs collaborate in a novel fashion in CKA1/CKA1S to enable tethering and targeting of PKC3. Avid ligation of a PKC isoform is a previously unappreciated function for a PTB module.
A secure cloud-edges computing architecture for metagenomics analysis. Portable sequencing machines, such as the Oxford Nanopore MinION, are making the genome sequencing ubiquitous. Consequently, metagenomic studies are becoming increasingly popular, yielding important insights into microbial communities covering diverse environments from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, the adoption of low-power IoT computing devices represents a feasible way of distributing and managing those machines on the field. However, a key issue is represented by the huge amount of data produced during operations, whose management is actually challenging considering the resources required for an efficient data transfer and processing. In order to deal with such a challenge, this paper put forward a novel architecture based on the coupling of Edge and Cloud computing paradigms. The focus of the paper is the Edge layer, responsible for the dynamic management of the full analysis pipeline of IoT devices producing large datasets like the MinION ones while adopting proper security mechanisms that handle the authentication of on-field devices and the confidentiality of the transmitted data.
A dominant point mutation in a RINGv E3 ubiquitin ligase homoeologous gene leads to cleistogamy in brassica napus. In the allopolyploid Brassica napus, we obtained a petal-closed flower mutation by ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis. Here, we report cloning and characterization of the Bn-CLG1A (CLG for cleistogamy) gene and the Bn-clg1A-1D mutant allele responsible for the cleistogamy phenotype. Bn-CLG1A encodes a RINGv E3 ubiquitin ligase that is highly conserved across eukaryotes. In the Bn-clg1A-1D mutant allele, a C-to-T transition converts a Pro at position 325 to a Leu (P325L), causing a dominant mutation leading to cleistogamy. B. napus and Arabidopsis thaliana plants transformed with a Bn-clg1A-1D allele show cleistogamous flowers, and characterization of these flowers suggests that the Bn-clg1A-1D mutation causes a pronounced negative regulation of cutin biosynthesis or loading and affects elongation or differentiation of petal and sepal cells. This results in an inhibition or a delay of petal development, leading to folded petals. A homoeologous gene (Bn-CLG1C), which shows 99.5% amino acid identity and is also constitutively and equally expressed to the wild-type Bn-CLG1A gene, was also identified. We showed that P325L is not a loss-of-function mutation and did not affect expression of Bn-clg1A-1D or Bn- CLG1C. Our findings suggest that P325L is a gain-of-function semidominant mutation, which led to either hyper- or neofunctionalization of a redundant homoeologous gene.
Deletion of gene gnd encoding 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase promotes l-serine biosynthesis in a genetically engineered strain of Methylobacterium sp. MB200. Objective: To identify potential target genes involved in l-serine biosynthesis in Methylobacterium sp. MB200 and to evaluate the gnd genetically-engineered strains for l-serine production. Results: Five genes that are not associated with the central metabolic pathway but with l-serine biosynthesis were identified from Methylobacterium sp. MB200 mutants. Gene gnd, encoding 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGDH), was selected for further evaluation. The gnd deletion mutant showed a 600% increase in d-serine tolerance and an 80% decrease in PGDH activity compared to Methylobacterium sp. MB200. gnd over-expression did not affect d-serine tolerance, whereas it did increase enzyme-activity up to 136%. Additionally, analysis revealed that in Methylobacterium sp. MB200, l-serine inhibited PGDH activity. The deletion of gnd did not affect growth, whereas it did enhance the biosynthesis of l-serine, resulting in a 225% increase in production of l-serine compared to the wild-type. Conclusion: gnd, one of the five genes identified here that is associated with l-serine synthesis, can be developed as a potential candidate for metabolic engineering to promote l-serine synthesis in Methylobacterium sp. MB200.
Testing the neutral theory of molecular evolution with genomic data from Drosophila. Although positive selection has been detected in many genes, its overall contribution to protein evolution is debatable. If the bulk of molecular evolution is neutral, then the ratio of amino-acid (A) to synonymous (S) polymorphism should, on average, equal that of divergence. A comparison of the A/S ratio of polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster with that of divergence from Drosophila simulans shows that the A/S ratio of divergence is twice as high - a difference that is often attributed to positive selection. But an increase in selective constraint owing to an increase in effective population size could also explain this observation, and, if so, all genes should be affected similarly. Here we show that the difference between polymorphism and divergence is limited to only a fraction of the genes, which are also evolving more rapidly, and this implies that positive selection is responsible. A higher A/S ratio of divergence than of polymorphism is also observed in other species, which suggests a rate of adaptive evolution that is far higher than permitted by the neutral theory of molecular evolution.
Research on Image Segmentation Algorithm Based on Multimodal Hierarchical Attention Mechanism and Genetic Neural Network. Multimodal tasks based on attention mechanism and language face numerous problems. Based on multimodal hierarchical attention mechanism and genetic neural network, this paper studies the application of image segmentation algorithm in data completion and 3D scene reconstruction. The algorithm refers to the process of concentrating attention that humans subjectively pay attention to and calculates the difference between each pixel in the genetic neural network test image in the color space and the average value of the target image, which solves the problem of static feature maps and dynamic feature maps of image sequences. In addition, in view of the problem that the number of attention enhancement feature extraction modules is too large and the parameters are too large, the recursive mechanism is used as the feature extraction branch, and new model parameters are not added when the network depth is increased. The simulation results show that the accuracy of the improved image saliency detection algorithm based on the attention mechanism reaches 89.7%, and the difference between the average value of the single-point pixel and the target image is reduced to 0.132, which further promotes the practicability and reliability of the image segmentation model.
Cell wall fracture properties in relation to lignin distribution and cell dimensions among three genetic groups of radiata pine. The position of fracture within the cell wall on split tangential longitudinal surfaces of air dry wood was quantified for three genetic groups of Pinus radiata D. Don. Differences in the position of fracture within the cell wall among these groups of trees were compared with lignin distribution and cell wall dimensions. In the control trees equivalent to typical New Zealand grown radiata pine, fracture occurred predominantly between the middle lamella and S1 layers as well as within the S1 layer, producing large numbers of fines on the fracture surface. In the open pollinated NZ850-55 group, fracture occurred predominantly between the S1 and S2 layers as well as within the S1 layer, producing fewer fines on the surface. In the NZ850-55 x Guadalupe group, fracture occurred in a similar fashion to the open pollinated group except for a greater number of transwall fractures exposing the cell lumen on the fracture surface. The differences in fracture behaviour between the control and genetically select groups are attributed to reduced lignification at the S1/S2 boundary in the genetically select trees. Observed differences in both the type of fracture and its location were unrelated to cell dimensions. These observations are discussed in relation to the observed differences in thermomechanical pulping properties exhibited by these groups of trees.
Transcriptome-wide identification of microRNAs in the roots of Pinus massoniana seedlings under Pi stress and Pi recovery. Phosphorus (Pi) deficiency is an important factor affecting plant growth and development, and there are still some gaps in the understanding of the underlying molecular mechanism of the response to low-Pi stress in Pinus massoniana. Through an integrated high-throughput sequencing analysis of the miRNAome and transcriptome, a comprehensive study of the global miRNAs and mRNAs of P. massoniana seedling roots was conducted under Pi stress and Pi recovery. miRNAome analysis showed that 31 mRNAs (306 target genes) were differentially expressed in P. massoniana seedling roots under Pi stress and that 80 miRNAs (1091 target genes) were differentially expressed after Pi recovery. Comprehensive analyses of the miRNAome and transcriptome showed that miR399, miR11413-y, miR529-y, novel-m0045-3p and other miRNAs may participate in the response of P. massoniana to low-Pi stress by regulating target genes. Some genes and miRNAs were randomly selected for RT-qPCR validation, and the detected expression levels were basically consistent with the sequencing results. These results provide valuable information for a more comprehensive understanding of the low-Pi-tolerance adaptation mechanisms of P. massoniana as well as other conifers.
Rapid detection of Brugia malayi in mosquito vectors using a real-time fluorescence resonance energy transfer PCR and melting curve analysis. We developed real-time fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with melting curve analysis for detection of Brugia malayi DNA in blood-fed mosquitoes. Real-time FRET PCR is based on a fluorescence melting curve analysis of hybrid formed between amplicons generated from a family of repeated DNA element, 153-bp HhaI repeated sequence, specific to genus Brugia and specific fluorophore-labeled probes. The B. malayi-infected mosquitoes were differentiated from Wuchereria bancrofti-infected and uninfected mosquitoes and from genomic DNA of Dirofilaria immitis- and Plasmodium falciparum-infected human red blood cells and human leukocytes by their melting temperature. Sensitivity and specificity were both 100%. Melting curve analysis produces a rapid, accurate, and sensitive alternative for specific detection of B. malayi in mosquitoes, allows high throughput, and can be performed on small samples. This method has the potential for endemic area mapping or monitoring effect of brugian filariasis mass treatment programs.
Phylogenomic analysis of 2556 single-copy protein-coding genes resolves most evolutionary relationships for the major clades in the most diverse group of lichen-forming fungi. Phylogenomic datasets continue to enhance our understanding of evolutionary relationships in many lineages of organisms. However, genome-scale data have not been widely implemented in reconstructing relationships in lichenized fungi. Here we generate a data set comprised of 2556 single-copy protein-coding genes to reconstruct previously unresolved relationships in the most diverse family of lichen-forming fungi, Parmeliaceae. Our sampling included 51 taxa, mainly from the subfamily Parmelioideae, and represented six of the seven previously identified major clades within the family. Our results provided strong support for the monophyly of each of these major clades and most backbone relationships in the topology were recovered with high nodal support based on concatenated dataset and species tree analyses. The alectorioid clade was strongly supported as sister-group to all remaining clades, which were divided into two major sister-groups. In the first major clade the anzioid and usneoid clades formed a strongly supported sister-group relationship with the cetrarioid + hypogymnioid group. The sister-group relationship of Evernia with the cetrarioid clade was also strongly supported, whereas that between the anzioid and usneoid clades needs further investigation. In the second major clade Oropogon and Platismatia were sister to the parmelioid group, while the position of Omphalora was not fully resolved. This study demonstrates the power of genome-scale data sets to resolve long-standing, ambiguous phylogenetic relationships of lichen-forming fungi. Furthermore, the topology inferred in this study will provide a valuable framework for better understanding diversification in the most diverse lineage of lichen-forming fungi, Parmeliaceae.
Bovine interferon-tau expression in Escherichia coli and identification of its biological activities. The bovine interferon-tau (bIFN-) gene, with signal sequence, was obtained through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from bovine early embryos and subcloned into a pGEM-T vector. After being verified, the fragments, with or without signal sequence, were inserted into the expression vector pET-30a(+). Two recombinant plasmids were induced to express the recombinant proteins by isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. The results showed that the bIFN- gene could be obtained from five bovine blastocysts by PCR without extraction of genomic DNA. It had 99% homology with nucleotides and 97% with amino acids in the GenBank sequence (accession number: XM-593584). The products of recombinant bIFN-, minus signal sequence, expressed in pET-30a(+) were analysed by SDS-PAGE. A new 20 kDa protein was detected and its molecular weight was as expected. The antiviral activity of recombinant bIFN- was 1104 IU/mg using a standard cytopathic reduction assay. Marked morphological changes were induced by recombinant bIFN- in bovine endometrial epithelial cells. The cell volume was larger than that of controls and a lot of vesicles appeared in the cytoplasm after 24 h culture in the presence of 2.9 g/ml recombinant bIFN-. In conclusion, a purified recombinant, biologically active bIFN- was obtained in this experiment.
Identifying randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers linked to major genes for common bacterial blight resistance in tepary bean. Common bacterial blight (CBB), incited by Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli (Xcp), is an important seed-transmitted disease of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Tepary bean (Phaseolus acutifolius A. Gray) has high resistance to Xcp. The objective of this study was to identify RAPD markers linked to genes controlling resistance to three isolates of Xcp using bulked segregant analysis in an F2 population from the tepary bean cross CIAT-G40005 (resistant to Xcp) x Nebr. 4B (susceptible to Xcp). Twelve RAPD markers were mapped in a coupling-phase linkage with three genes for resistance to Xcp. The linkage group spanned a distance of 19.2 cM. A marker L7750 was linked to the genes for resistance to Xcp strains EK-11 and LB-2 at 8.4 cM and 2.4 cM, respectively. Markers U10400 and Y14600 were detected as flanking markers for the resistance gene to Xcp strain SC-4A at 2.4 cM and 7.2 cM, respectively. The symbols Xcp-1, Xcp-2, and Xcp-3 were assigned for the genes for resistance to Xcp strains EK-11, LB-2, and SC-4A, respectively. RAPD markers linked to the genes for resistance to Xcp could be used for transferring all of the resistance genes from P. acutifolius to a susceptible P. vulgaris cultivar.
The sterol modifying enzyme LET-767 is essential for growth, reproduction and development in Caenorhabditis elegans. The let-767 gene encodes a protein that is similar to mammalian steroid enzymes that are responsible for the reduction of 17-beta hydroxysteroid hormones. Caenorhabditis elegans is incapable of the de novo synthesis of cholesterol. Therefore, this free-living nematode must extract cholesterol from its environment and modify it to form steroid hormones that are necessary for its survival. C. elegans is unable to survive in the absence of supplemental cholesterol, and is therefore sensitive to cholesterol limitation. We show that a mutation in let-767 results in hypersensitivity to cholesterol limitation, supporting the hypothesis that LET-767 acts on a sterol derivative. Furthermore, let-767 mutants exhibit defects in embryogenesis, female reproduction and molting. Although ecdysone is the major molting hormone in insects, there is as yet no evidence for ecdysone synthesis in C. elegans, suggesting that a different hormone is required for molting in C. elegans. Our results suggest that LET-767 modifies a sterol hormone that is required both for embryogenesis and for later stages of development.
Fibropapillomatosis in green turtles Chelonia mydas in Brazil: Characteristics of tumors and virus. Fibropapillomatosis (FP) is a benign neoplasia that affects physiological functions of sea turtles and may lead to death. High prevalence of FP in sea turtle populations has prompted several research groups to study the disease and the associated herpesvirus, chelonid herpesvirus 5 (ChHV5). The present study detected and quantified ChHV5 in 153 fibropapilloma samples collected from green turtles Chelonia mydas on the Brazilian coast between 2009 and 2010 to characterize the relationship between viral load and tumor characteristics. Of the tumor samples collected, 73 and 87% were positive for ChHV5 in conventional PCR and real-time PCR, respectively, and viral loads ranged between 1 and 118.62 copies cell-1. Thirty-three percent of turtles were mildly, 28% were moderately and 39% were severely affected with FP. Skin samples were used as negative control. High viral loads correlated positively with increasing FP severity in turtles sampled on the Brazilian coast and with samples from turtles found dead in the states of São Paulo and Bahia. Six viral variants were detected in tumor samples, 4 of which were similar to the Atlantic phylogenetic group. Two variants were similar to the western Atlantic/eastern Caribbean phylogenetic group. Co-infection in turtles with more than one variant was observed in the states of São Paulo and Bahia.
Investigation of protein-nucleic interactions in tobacco mosaic virus by the method of spin label and fluorescence. The authors have investigated protein-nucleic interactions in tobacco mosaic virus reconstructed in vitro. It was found that RNA links up with protein in the region of lysine 53 of the protein chain. It is shown that at μ 0·2 and pH 7·2 when protein is in the form of discs there is "exposed" for interaction a portion of protein which is inaccessible at a low ionic strength of the solution μ < 0·1 when protein is in the form of A-protein. It is assumed that this change in the conformation of the protein molecule accounts for the need for disc aggregates and for the initiation of reconstruction.
Variations on a theme in fruit development: the PLE lineage of MADS-box genes in tomato (TAGL1) and other species. Main conclusion: This article focuses on the role of TOMATO AGAMOUS-LIKE 1 (TAGL1) on a wide range of ripening functions in tomato. We also examine orthologs of this gene in related species that produce different fruit types and discuss some evolutionary implications. TOMATO AGAMOUS-LIKE 1 (TAGL1) is a MADS-box transcription factor gene that belongs to the PLENA (PLE) lineage within the AGAMOUS (AG) clade. The most well-studied genes in this lineage are the SHATTERPROOF (SHP) genes in Arabidopsis, known to be involved in dehiscence zone formation during silique development. In tomato, TAGL1 has been shown to control several aspects of tomato fruit ripening. Most notably, carotenoid synthesis seems to be controlled by TAGL1, likely via the ethylene synthesis and signaling pathway and in combination with RIPENING INHIBITOR (RIN). In addition, TAGL1 regulates genes involved in cell cycle regulation, flavonoid and lignin biosynthesis, and cuticle development. We discuss many of the genes in these different pathways that are likely controlled by TAGL1, directly or indirectly. We also examine the relationship of TAGL1 with known and putative interaction partners. PLE lineage genes have also been examined in other species such as Antirrhinum, Petunia, and Nicotiana and provide an interesting example of conservation and diversification of function in species that produce very different types of fleshy and dry fruits. The control of lignification may be a common mechanism for this group of genes. Lastly, we discuss future work needed to elucidate the TAGL1 regulatory pathway in tomato and to help better understand the functional diversification of genes in this lineage in related species.
Global small RNA analysis in fast-growing Arabidopsis thaliana with elevated concentrations of ATP and sugars. Background: In higher eukaryotes, small RNAs play a role in regulating gene expression. Overexpression (OE) lines of Arabidopsis thaliana purple acid phosphatase 2 (AtPAP2) were shown to grow faster and exhibit higher ATP and sugar contents. Leaf microarray studies showed that many genes involved in microRNAs (miRNAs) and trans-acting siRNAs (tasiRNAs) biogenesis were significantly changed in the fast-growing lines. In this study, the sRNA profiles of the leaf and the root of 20-day-old plants were sequenced and the impacts of high energy status on sRNA expression were analyzed.Results: 9-13 million reads from each library were mapped to genome. miRNAs, tasiRNAs and natural antisense transcripts-generated small interfering RNAs (natsiRNAs) were identified and compared between libraries. In the leaf of OE lines, 15 known miRNAs increased in abundance and 9 miRNAs decreased in abundance, whereas in the root of OE lines, 2 known miRNAs increased in abundance and 9 miRNAs decreased in abundance. miRNAs with increased abundance in the leaf and root samples of both OE lines (miR158b and miR172a/b) were predicted to target mRNAs coding for Dof zinc finger protein and Apetala 2 (AP2) proteins, respectively. Furthermore, a significant change in the miR173-tasiRNAs-PPR/TPR network was observed in the leaves of both OE lines.Conclusion: In this study, the impact of high energy content on the sRNA profiles of Arabidopsis is reported. While the abundance of many stress-induced miRNAs is unaltered, the abundance of some miRNAs related to plant growth and development (miR172 and miR319) is elevated in the fast-growing lines. An induction of miR173-tasiRNAs-PPR/TPR network was also observed in the OE lines. In contrast, only few cis- and trans-natsiRNAs are altered in the fast-growing lines.
Inoculation methods of Xanthomonas campestris pv. passiflorae in passion fruits and biofertilizers on bacterial growth inhibition in vitro. The passion fruit (Passiflora spp.) bacterial spot caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. passiflorae is one of the major diseases that affects the culture. To obtain varieties resistant to this bacterium, several inoculation methods should be tested. The objective of this study was to evaluate different methods of Xanthomonas campestris pv. passiflorae inoculation in passion fruits and to evaluate the inhibitory effect of biofertilizers on bacterial growth in vitro. Seven passion fruit genotypes were inoculated with a bacterial suspension (1×108 CFU.mL-1) by spraying, scissors and tweezers. The biofertilizers Agro-Mos, Cop-R-Quik, FitoForce Plus and Soil-Set were evaluated for bacterial growth inhibition in vitro. Spraying was the most practical and rapid inoculation method, in relation to the others, in obtaining the disease symptoms, and all evaluated genotypes were susceptible to Xanthomonas campestris pv. passiflorae. The biofertilizers FitoForce Plus and Soil-Set inhibited Xanthomonas campestris pv. passiflorae growth in vitro and should be evaluated for the bacterium control under field conditions.
Chromosome segregation in Archaea: SegA– and SegB–DNA complex structures provide insights into segrosome assembly. Genome segregation is a vital process in all organisms. Chromosome partitioning remains obscure in Archaea, the third domain of life. Here, we investigated the SegAB system from Sulfolobus solfataricus. SegA is a ParA Walker-type ATPase and SegB is a site-specific DNA-binding protein. We determined the structures of both proteins and those of SegA–DNA and SegB–DNA complexes. The SegA structure revealed an atypical, novel non-sandwich dimer that binds DNA either in the presence or in the absence of ATP. The SegB structure disclosed a ribbon–helix–helix motif through which the protein binds DNA site specifically. The association of multiple interacting SegB dimers with the DNA results in a higher order chromatin-like structure. The unstructured SegB N-terminus plays an essential catalytic role in stimulating SegA ATPase activity and an architectural regulatory role in segrosome (SegA–SegB–DNA) formation. Electron microscopy results also provide a compact ring-like segrosome structure related to chromosome organization. These findings contribute a novel mechanistic perspective on archaeal chromosome segregation.
Evolution of a global regulator: Lrp in four orders of γ-Proteobacteria. Background: Bacterial global regulators each regulate the expression of several hundred genes. In Escherichia coli, the top seven global regulators together control over half of all genes. Leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) is one of these top seven global regulators. Lrp orthologs are very widely distributed, among both Bacteria and Archaea. Surprisingly, even within the phylum γ-Proteobacteria (which includes E. coli), Lrp is a global regulator in some orders and a local regulator in others. This raises questions about the evolution of Lrp and, more broadly, of global regulators. Results: We examined Lrp sequences from four bacterial orders of the γ-Proteobacteria using phylogenetic and Logo analyses. The orders studied were Enterobacteriales and Vibrionales, in which Lrp plays a global role in tested species; Pasteurellales, in which Lrp is a local regulator in the tested species; and Alteromonadales, an order closely related to the other three but in which Lrp has not yet been studied. For comparison, we analyzed the Lrp paralog AsnC, which in all tested cases is a local regulator. The Lrp and AsnC phylogenetic clusters each divided, as expected, into subclusters representing the Enterobacteriales, Vibrionales, and Pasteuralles. However the Alteromonadales did not yield coherent clusters for either Lrp or AsnC. Logo analysis revealed signatures associated with globally- vs. locally- acting Lrp orthologs, providing testable hypotheses for which portions of Lrp are responsible for a global vs. local role. These candidate regions include both ends of the Lrp polypeptide but not, interestingly, the highly-conserved helix-turn-helix motif responsible for DNA sequence specificity. Conclusions: Lrp and AsnC have conserved sequence signatures that allow their unambiguous annotation, at least in γ-Proteobacteria. Among Lrp orthologs, specific residues correlated with global vs. local regulatory roles, and can now be tested to determine which are functionally relevant and which simply reflect divergence. In the Alteromonadales, it appears that there are different subgroups of Lrp orthologs, one of which may act globally while the other may act locally. These results suggest experiments to improve our understanding of the evolution of bacterial global regulators.
Biodegradation of pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene in the liquid matrix and soil by a newly identified Raoultella planticola strain. In the current study, the PL7 strain was isolated from soil and identified as Raoultella planticola based on its physiological characteristics and 16S rDNA sequence. By the 10th day, the PL7 strain degraded 52.0% of the pyrene (PYR) content and 50.8% of the benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) content in 20\xa0mg\xa0L−1 PYR and 10\xa0mg\xa0L−1 BaP in the liquid matrix. The half-life of PYR and BaP by PL7 degradation was 8.59 and 9.46\xa0days, respectively. At pH 8.0, the degradation rates of PYR and BaP by PL7 were significantly higher at 30\xa0°C than at 20 and 40\xa0°C. The degradation ability of PL7 differed in red soil, paddy soil and fluvo-aquic soil; red soil produced the fastest degradation rates. The half-life of PYR and BaP by PL7 degradation in red soil was 21.7 and 11.9\xa0days, respectively; however, without PL7 the half-life of PYR in red soil was 91.2\xa0days. This study demonstrated the significant potential of the PL7 strain for bioremediation applications in the liquid matrix and soil contaminated by PAHs.
Minimum weight design of sinusoidal corrugated web beam using differential evolution algorithm. Due to their many advantages, corrugated steel plates are widely used in various applications including bridges. Starting with airplane design, these corrugated steel plates have been used in civil engineering applications such as buildings and bridges, and many studies on corrugated steel plates are being conducted. However, most of these studies focused on the strength of girders through analysis and experiment of corrugated steel plates and studies on the optimization of corrugated steel plates are still insufficient. The present study developed the weight optimum design using the differential evolution and investigated the effects of parameters. The optimization program was verified with differential evolution through the numerical analysis examples of simple beams and fixed beams. For this verification, the optimization program using the genetic algorithm that has been studied was compared with the weight optimum graph of the optimization program of differential evolution proposed in this study. As a result, the graphs of these two optimization programs increased similarly. The change rate was 3.57% or lower in the example of uniformly load for fixed beam, 1.60% or lower in the example of concentrated load for fixed beam, and 1.44% or lower in the example of uniformly load for simple beam. Furthermore, in the graph of changing design variables, the changing web thickness showed a similar trend as the increasing trend of the optimum sectional area.
Effects of anthropogenic disturbances on natural regeneration and population structure of gum arabic tree (Acacia senegal) in the woodlands of Lake Baringo ecosystem, Kenya. Despite the ecological and economic importance of Acacia senegal, little is known about the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on its natural regeneration patterns and population structure. We investigated the effects of these factors within the Lake Baringo woodland ecosystem. Data was collected from 60 plots of 20 m\xa0×\xa020 m systematically distributed in four A. senegal-dominated populations within the Lake Baringo woodland. Sample populations spanned a degradation gradient measured by a population disturbance index (PDI). Trees were measured for diameter at breast height (DBH) and categorized by growth stages: seedling, sapling and adult tree. Higher seedling and sapling densities were recorded in lightly than heavily disturbed populations, but only sapling density was significantly different between the two disturbance levels (P = 0.02). Lightly disturbed populations revealed a reversed J-shape size-class distribution (SCD) indicative of stable structure unlike the heavily disturbed populations. The quotient and permutation indices indicated unstable populations with episodic recruitment and mortality. Our study reveals that natural regeneration and population structure of A. senegal were affected majorly by selective harvesting and heavy browsing. Suitable management strategies to control livestock grazing and illegal tree harvesting within the woodland is required to promote conservation of the species genetic resources.
Interstitial hybridization sites of the (TTAGGG)n telomeric sequence on the chromosomes of some North American hylid frogs. Interstitial hybridization sites for the (TTAGGG)n telomeric repeat sequence were present in all seven species of hylid frogs examined and in a triploid hybrid between two of the species. Intra- and interspecific differences and similarities in hybridization sites agreed with what is known about the systematics of these species. Chromosome fusions, fissions, and inversions do not appear to have played a role in the evolution of the interstitial sites for the telomeric repeat in the species examined.
Toward a comprehensive developmental model for major depression in women. Objective: Major depression is a multifactorial disorder with many etiologic variables that are interrelated through developmental pathways. The authors used structural equation modeling to generate a developmental model for the etiology of major depression in women. Method: Data from 1,942 adult female twins, interviewed up to four times over a 9-year period, were used to construct a developmental model to predict depressive episodes in the year before the most recent interview. Eighteen risk factors in five developmental tiers were considered: 1) childhood (genetic risk, disturbed family environment, childhood sexual abuse, and childhood parental loss), 2) early adolescence (neuroticism, self-esteem, and early-onset anxiety and conduct disorder), 3) late adolescence (educational attainment, lifetime traumas, social support, and substance misuse), 4) adulthood (history of divorce and past history of major depression), and 5) the last year (marital problems, difficulties, and stressful life events). Results: The best fitting model included six correlations and 64 paths, provided an excellent fit to the data, and explained 52% of the variance in liability to episodes of major depression. The findings suggest that the development of risk for major depression in women results from three broad pathways reflecting internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and psychosocial adversity. Conclusions: Major depression is an etiologically complex disorder, the full understanding of which will require consideration of a broad array of risk factors from multiple domains. These results, while plausible, should be treated with caution because of problems with causal inference, retrospective recall bias, and the limitations of a purely additive statistical model.
Bats as natural samplers: First record of the invasive pest rice water weevil Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus in the Iberian Peninsula. We face an increasing global food security challenge as the human population continues to grow across the globe. As agricultural production rises to keep up with food demand, so too does the expansion of crop detrimental pest species. Early detection can be crucial to control their damage and relies on the use of accurate and dependable techniques. We report the first record of rice water weevil (Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus) in the Iberian Peninsula. The distribution range expansion of this invasive rice pest weevil is confirmed through traditional sampling and through natural sampling by bats combined with DNA metabarcoding, a non-invasive technique with strong potential for early detection of pests in agricultural areas. Presence of rice water weevil was confirmed genetically from bat faecal samples collected from a Pipistrellus pygmaeus bat roost in the Ebro Delta (Catalonia, Spain). The known distribution of this rice pest, native to North America, now includes four of the top five rice-producing European countries. To date, the economic damage caused by this pest in Europe is minimal and concentrated in small areas, but chemical and agronomic controls are implemented to control their populations. The nature of this record highlights the potential of insectivorous bats as natural samplers to detect (and possibly control) pest species in crops. Further studies are required to determine the full extent of the rice water weevil's spread, and to investigate integrated pest management systems, including biological control to suppress their populations.
Isolation of pathogenic Leptospira strains from naturally infected cattle in Uruguay reveals high serovar diversity, and uncovers a relevant risk for human leptospirosis. Leptospirosis is a neglected zoonosis with worldwide distribution. The causative agents are spirochete bacteria of the Leptospira genus, displaying huge diversity of serovars, the identity of which is critical for effective diagnosis and vaccination purposes. Among many other mammalian species, Leptospira infects cattle, eliciting acute signs in calves, and chronic disease in adult animals often leading to abortions. In South America, and including in Uruguay, beef and dairy export are leading sources of national income. Despite the importance of bovine health, food safety, and bovine-related dissemination of leptospirosis to humans, extremely limited information is available as to the identity of Leptospira species and serovars infecting cattle in Uruguay and the South American subcontinent. Here we report a multicentric 3-year study resulting in the isolation and detailed characterization of 40 strains of Leptospira spp. obtained from infected cattle. Combined serologic and molecular typing identified these isolates as L. interrogans serogroup Pomona serovar Kennewicki (20 strains), L. interrogans serogroup Canicola serovar Canicola (1 strain), L. borgpetersenii serogroup Sejroe serovar Hardjo (10 strains) and L. noguchii (9 strains). The latter showed remarkable phenotypic and genetic variability, belonging to 6 distinct serogroups, including 3 that did not react with a large panel of reference serogrouping antisera. Approximately 20% of cattle sampled in the field were found to be shedding pathogenic Leptospira in their urine, uncovering a threat for public health that is being largely neglected. The two L. interrogans serovars that we isolated from cattle displayed identical genetic signatures to those of human isolates that had previously been obtained from leptospirosis patients. This report of local Leptospira strains shall improve diagnostic tools and the understanding of leptospirosis epidemiology in South America. These strains could also be used as new components within bacterin vaccines to protect against the pathogenic Leptospira strains that are actually circulating, a direct measure to reduce the risk of human leptospirosis.
Populations of the cattle tick (Boophilus microplus) on purebred Nellore, Ibage and Nellore × European crossbreds in the Brazilian savanna. Studies on purebred Nellore cattle and their crosses with Fleckvieh, Chianina, Charolais and the Ibagé breed (5/8 Aberdeen Angus, 3/8 Nellore) during 39 months in the field gave mean daily counts for engorging female ticks of 3·3, 25·2, 22·2, 21·0 and 59·7 per animal respectively. Annual fluctuations were similar in all groups; with the exception of the purebred Nellore mean counts are at levels considered dangerous for the stability of enzootic tick fever.
Forelimb versus hindlimb skeletal development in the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus: Functional divergence is reflected in chondrocytic performance in autopodial growth plates. The morphology of the chiropteran forelimb demonstrates musculoskeletal specializations for powered flight essentially unique among mammals, including extreme elongation of the distal skeletal elements. Recent studies have focused primarily on the relative timing and levels of gene expression during early stages of endochondral ossification in the chiropteran embryo for clues to the molecular basis of the evolutionary origins of flight in these species. The goal of the current study was to examine how elongation of skeletal elements of the forelimb autopod is achieved through a combination of cellular proliferation, cellular enlargement and matrix synthesis during a period of rapid postnatal growth in Eptesicus fuscus. Quantitative analyses were done of multiple performance parameters of growth plate chondrocytes during all phases of the differentiation cascade. Fourteen autopodial growth plates from the forelimb and hindlimb of one individual, as well as the proximal tibial growth plate, were collected and analyzed. Significant differences were seen in all performance parameters examined. Particularly striking were the differences between growth plates of the manus and pes in the size of the pool of chondrocytes in all cellular zones and rates of turnover of terminal cells. The magnitude of hypertrophy of chondrocytes in growth plates of the manus in E. fuscus far exceeded what has been reported previously in any species, even in rapidly elongating rodent long bones. Volume changes approaching ×70 and height changes of 50-60 μm/cell (paralleling the direction of growth) occurred after proliferation in the most rapidly growing growth plates. The data demonstrate that final differences in lengths of homologous skeletal elements in the autopod of the forelimb and hindlimb of this species result not just from an initiating factor early in development, but from continued quantitative differences in chondrocytic performance during postnatal bone elongation as measured by multiple kinetic-based parameters.
Genomes of surface isolates of Alteromonas macleodii: The life of a widespread marine opportunistic copiotroph. Alteromonas macleodii is a marine gammaproteobacterium with widespread distribution in temperate or tropical waters. We describe three genomes of isolates from surface waters around Europe (Atlantic, Mediterranean and Black Sea) and compare them with a previously described deep Mediterranean isolate (AltDE) that belongs to a widely divergent clade. The surface isolates are quite similar, the most divergent being the Black Sea (BS11) isolate. The genomes contain several genomic islands with different gene content. The recruitment of very similar genomic fragments from metagenomes in different locations indicates that the surface clade is globally abundant with little effect of geography, even the AltDE and the BS11 genomes recruiting from surface samples in open ocean locations. The finding of CRISPR protospacers of AltDE in a lysogenic phage in the Atlantic (English Channel) isolate illustrates a flow of genetic material among these clades and a remarkably wide distribution of this phage.
Two-stage product platform development for mass customisation. Designing new products based on those features (platforms) that have proven successful or 'fit' is generally termed as 'platform product development (PPD)'. This approach provides a basis for mass customisation (MC) which largely enhances an enterprise's competitiveness in terms of the speed, quality and cost. Currently, however, the PPD approach is heavily dependent on the experience and skills of individual designers and managers. Researchers have been working on platform leveraging strategies at the strategic level, and guidelines for better structuring the approach to facilitate its adoption and implementation. This research project recognises an equal need for scientific decision supports at the tactical level for design practitioners and managers to address fundamental questions such as: (A) how a platform should be established for a family of products in a given industrial and market context; and (B) how a product development team chooses and then customises the most appropriate product platform to meet the customer requirements from a specific market segment with particular manufacturing resources and supply bases. This paper describes a scientific and effective decision - genetic algorithm to assist product development practitioners and managers with major decision activities in the process of platform product development under several focus areas.
Trasfugen: Traffic assignment of urban network by an approximation fuzzy genetic algorithm. This paper proposes the Trasfugen method for traffic assignment aimed at solving the user equilibrium problem. To this end, the method makes use of a genetic algorithm. A fuzzy system is proposed for controlling the mutation and crossover rates of the genetic algorithm, and the corrective strategy is exploited for handling the equilibrium problem constraints. In the model, an approximation algorithm is proposed for obtaining the paths between the origin-destination pairs in the demand matrix. Unlike the traditional deterministic algorithm that has exponential time complexity, this approximation algorithm has polynomial time complexity and is executed much faster. Afterward, the Trasfugen method is applied to the urban network of Tehran metropolitan and the efficiency is investigated. Upon comparing the results obtained from the proposed model with those obtained from the conventional traffic assignment method, namely, the Frank-Wolfe method; it is shown that the proposed algorithm, while acting worse during the initial iterations, achieves better results in the subsequent iterations. Moreover, it prevents the occurrence of local optimal points as well as early/premature convergence, thus producing better results than the Frank-Wolfe algorithm.
Functional studies of aegerolysin and MACPF-like proteins in Aspergillus niger. Proteins of the aegerolysin family have a high abundance in Fungi. Due to their specific binding to membrane lipids, and their membrane-permeabilization potential in concert with protein partner(s) belonging to a membrane-attack-complex/perforin (MACPF) superfamily, they were proposed as useful tools in different biotechnological and biomedical applications. In this work, we performed functional studies on expression of the genes encoding aegerolysin and MACPF-like proteins in Aspergillus niger. Our results suggest the sporulation process being crucial for strong induction of the expression of all these genes. However, deletion of either of the aegerolysin genes did not influence the growth, development, sporulation efficiency and phenotype of the mutants, indicating that aegerolysins are not key factors in the sporulation process. In all our expression studies we noticed a strong correlation in the expression of one aegerolysin and MACPF-like gene. Aegerolysins were confirmed to be secreted from the fungus. We also showed the specific interaction of a recombinant A. niger aegerolysin with an invertebrate-specific membrane sphingolipid. Moreover, using this protein labelled with mCherry we successfully stained insect cells membranes containing this particular sphingolipid. Our combined results suggest, that aegerolysins in this species, and probably also in other aspergilli, could be involved in defence against predators.
Biological Invasion of Medically Important Bladder Snail Physella acuta Draparnaud, 1805 (Gastropoda, Physidae) in the Freshwater Habitat of Kerala, India. The acute bladder snail, Physella acuta (Draparnaud 1805) is globally considered as a highly invasive snail and it is synonymised to Physa acuta. This species is host to many trematodes causing foodborne diseases in humans. In the present study, P. acuta is recorded for the first time from Kerala state with its first mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene sequence from India. Twenty-three live specimens of P. acuta were collected from the Edappally Canal in Kochi, Kerala, India using a standard scoop net. The species was identified by morphological studies and confirmed using the barcoding technique. The snail was found attached to invasive freshwater plant Ceratophyllum demersum and other gastropod species Indoplanorbis exustus and Racesina luteola. The density of P. acuta was recorded as 25 ± 10 individuals per 50\xa0cm long shoot. The shell length of the snail ranged between 3.2 and 7 mm, shell width 2–4 mm, aperture length 2.4–5.2 mm, aperture width 1–2 mm, and spire height 0.9–1.8 mm. The dead vacant shell has brownish yellow in colour while the live individuals were translucent having golden yellowish colour. The nucleotide BLAST results showed 100% similarity with the P. acuta sequences reported from Iraq. The specimen also showed a close match with the mtDNA COI sequence from Singapore, Thailand, Southeast Europe, France, Chile and the United States. The introduction of the snail to India is mainly through the aquarium trade. Their rapid growth rate, air-breathing capabilities and pollution tolerance make them a potential competitor to the native fauna. Besides, they could act as mediators of foodborne diseases in this southern state of the country.
Will Climate Warming Alter Biotic Stresses in Wild Lowbush Blueberries?. As global temperatures rise, a growing need exists for understanding the impacts of warming on crop production. Warming not only changes crop physiology and growth but also the weeds, insect pests, and diseases of crops including wild lowbush blueberries, which have not been studied till now. Changes in pest pressures can cause instability in production and will require changes in management practices and the development of mitigation strategies. The objective of this study was to determine the impacts of warming on the prevalence of major weeds, insect pests, and diseases of the wild blueberry production system. We selected six genotypes of wild lowbush blueberries in a commercially managed wild blueberry field in Maine Northeast USA and used open-top-chambers (OTCs) to study the effects of warming for two years (2019 and 2020). Both active-heating OTCs (elevated monthly mean temperatures by 3.3◦ C) and passive-heating OTCs (elevated by 1.2◦ C) were employed and compared with ambient controls. Our results showed that warming did not change the prevalence of red leaf disease, blueberry gall midge, red-striped fireworm, or any weed species. In contrast, the incidence of Sphaerulina leaf spot, powdery mildew, and other leaf spot disease were significantly lower under warming treatments compared to the ambient control at the end of the growing season in 2020. Overall, different pests responded to warming differently, inviting further research to reveal the mechanisms. The lower overall pressure of leaf spot disease under warming was probably due to decreased air humidity.
Integrated lysis procedures reduce extraction biases of microbial DNA from mangrove sediment. Sufficient lysis of soil or sediment microbes is a critical step for analyzing microbial community structures and for preparing metagenomic DNA libraries. The present study compared lysis methods for recovering archaeal, bacterial, actinomycete, and fungal DNAs from a mangrove sediment sample. PCR results showed that individual procedures using SDS, lysozyme, sonication, freeze-thaw, microwave, and vigorous shaking could extract archaeal or bacterial DNA but failed for actinomycetes or fungi cells. In comparison, an integrated lysis procedure using SDS, lysozyme, and vigorous shaking successfully obtained fungal DNA, and a combination of SDS, lysozyme, vigorous shaking, and microwave treatments recovered DNA from actinomycetes. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) results showed that although single lysis procedures can lyse bacterial DNA, all of them assessed the indigenous bacterial community structure with significant biases. The integrated lysis protocols described in the present study could be useful for extracting DNA from various types of sediments.
Individual responses to predation risk and food density in perch (Perca fluviatilis L.). Perch, Perca fluviatilis, of different sizes and ages were allowed to choose between two feeding patches differing in food ratio and (or) predation risk (presence versus absence of a pike, Esox lucius). The aim of our study was to test whether food-patch choice and risk-taking behaviour (time with the predator present) were related to size, phenotype (fast- versus slow-growing) and (or) stage of development (mature versus immature). Movements of individual fish were continuously monitored with an automatic system employing passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags. Food distribution did not seem to be important in determining perch distribution. Predation risk, however, had a significant influence. The presence of a predator in a patch significantly reduced the proportion of time spent in that feeding patch by all perch. However, the strength of this effect was dependent on individual characteristics, both the slow-growing phenotype and the mature fish spending a significantly lower proportion of time in the risky patch than the fast-growing and immature fish. Switching rates, which differed between character groups, also had an effect on growth rate, varying with predation risk.
Tree genetics strongly affect forest productivity, but intraspecific diversity–productivity relationships do not. Numerous studies have demonstrated biodiversity–productivity relationships in plant communities, and analogous genetic diversity–productivity studies using genotype mixtures of single species may show similar patterns. Alternatively, competing individuals among genotypes within a species are less likely to exhibit resource-use complementarity, even when they exhibit large differences in their effects on ecosystem function. In this study, we test the impact of genotype diversity and genetic identity on ecosystem function using an ecosystem-scale common garden experiment. Distinct tree genotypes were collected across the entire natural range of the riparian tree Populus fremontii in the USA, and grown in 1–16 genotype combination forest stands. Due to the warm climate and irrigation of the planting location along the Colorado River (AZ, USA), mature forest physiognomy with trees up to 19\xa0m tall was achieved in just five years. Several key patterns emerged: (i) genotype richness did not predict forest productivity, suggesting a lack of net biodiversity effects; (ii) we found differences among genotype monoculture stands comparable to differences in average productivity across all forest biomes on Earth; (iii) productivity was predicted based on genetic marker similarity in trees; (iv) genetic-based differences in leaf phenology (early leaf-on and late leaf-fall timing) were correlated with >80% of the variation in tree and forest productivity irrespective of home-site conditions. Large differences in productivity among genotypes can result in dramatic differences in forest productivity without resulting in diversity–productivity relationships that are present in species-scale biodiversity studies.
Resistance to lettuce aphid (Nasonovia ribisnigri) biotype 0 in wild lettuce accessions PI 491093 and PI 274378. The lettuce aphid, Nasonovia ribisnigri Mosley (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is a major insect pest of lettuce, Lactuca sativa L, in many commercial lettuce production areas around the world. Resistance to lettuce aphid biotype 0 (Nr:0) was first reported in Lactuca virosa L. accession IVT 280 and characterized as complete, i.e., virtually no aphids survived, and genetically dominant to partial resistance in L. virosa accession IVT 273. Complete and partial resistances to Nr:0 were conditioned by two alleles, Nr (complete resistance) and nr (partial resistance), but the genetic relationship to susceptibility was not reported. We previously reported two new potential sources of unique genes for resistance to Nr:0 in Lactuca serriola L. accession PI 491093 and L. virosa PI 274378. We report on the genetic and phenotypic nature of resistance to Nr:0 in these two wild lettuce accessions. Resistance to Nr:0 in PI 274378 is complete and allelic to complete resistance in IVT 280. Resistance to Nr:0 in PI 491093 was partial, recessive to complete resistance in 'Barcelona' that was derived from IVT 280, but dominant to susceptibility in 'Salinas'. We propose the revised gene symbols for resistance to Nr:0: Nr:0C for complete resistance and Nr:0P for partial resistance, which was originally designated as nr but may now be regarded as the symbol for susceptibility to all strains of lettuce aphid. The dominance relationships among these three alleles are Nr:0C (in IVT 280, 'Barcelona') > Nr:0P (in PI 491093) > nr (in susceptible genotypes). Expression of partial resistance in PI 491093 was variable in controlled infestation tests, but in a naturally infested field test provided a potentially useful level of resistance to Nr:0. Partial resistance, where complete resistance has not been widely deployed, may either alone or as a component of integrated pest management delay or prevent emergence of genotypes that overcome complete resistance controlled by Nr:0C.
Histological and hematological alterations of silver catfish Rhamdia quelen highly parasitized by Lernaea cyprinacea. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the histological and hematological alterations of silver catfish Rhamdia quelen (Quoy & Gaimard, 1824) against intense parasitism by anchor worm Lernaea cyprinacea Linnaeus, 1758. Thirteen fish specimens were collected at the Fish Genetic Improvement Unit (EPAGRI/CEDAP), Brazil. After acclimatization, the fish were anesthetized for blood collection, and the samples were used for counting thrombocytes, total leukocytes, differential leukocytes and for quantification of total erythrocytes. Afterwards, the animals were euthanized, the parasites removed and quantified, and the portions of the affected tegument fixed in 10% buffered formalin. All the analyzed animals were parasitized by L. cyprinacea with mean intensity of 192 specimens per fish. The hematological profile of the animals was different from that reported for healthy fish. Immature leukocytes were the most abundant cells, followed by mono-cytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and periodic acid-Schiff-positive granular leukocytes. A small number of neutrophils were present in the bloodstream of parasitized fish, while histological examination evidenced the accumulation of this cell type near the place of infection by the parasite. Total leukocytes correlated significantly and positively (r = 0.6, p = 0.030) with the intensity of L. cyprinacea infection and the fish weight. Histological changes included hemorrhage, liquefactive necrosis and connective tissue disarrangement, necrosis, granulomatous inflammation, mononu-clear and polynuclear inflammation, as well as hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the alarm and mucous cells. The L. cyprinacea infection intensity caused deleterious changes both in the hematological profile and the integument of R. quelen, confirming the pathogenic potential of this parasite to the affected fish species.
Inheritance of coat colour in the German Pinscher dog. The two primary colour varieties of the German Pinscher breed are the red and the black and tan. Respectively, these are produced by the dominant yellow allele Ayand the black and tan allele atof the agouti locus. The dilute gene d is present in the breed at a low frequency and produces the rarer isabella and blue and tan colours, with the genotypes Ay-dd and atdd, respectively.
Cytochrome c peroxidase contributes to the antioxidant defense of Cryptococcus neoformans. Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic pathogen and the leading cause of fungal meningitis. To survive within the host, this organism must be able to protect itself from oxidative stress. Cytochrome c peroxidase (Ccp1) is a mitochondrial antioxidant that catalyzes the degradation of hydrogen peroxide. In the present study, we characterized the contribution of the C. neoformans Ccp1 to antioxidant defense and for virulence. Consistent with studies of Ccp1 function in Sacchromyces cerevisiae, we found that Ccp1 contributes to resistance against exogenous oxidative stress in vitro. However, the oxidative stress phenotype does not diminish the virulence of ccp1 mutant strains in a murine model of C. neoformans disease. These results suggest that Ccp1 is involved in a complex system of protection against exogenous oxidative stress and that the elimination of this component of the antioxidant defense system does not diminish the virulence of C. neoformans.
How does Helicobacter pylori cause duodenal ulcer disease: The bug, the host, or both?. Abstract Helicobacter pylori infection is the most common cause of duodenal ulcer disease, yet duodenal ulcer is an uncommon outcome of H. pylori infection. We reviewed the possible explanations such as differences in the host or in the strain of H. pylori. Host factors reviewed included genetic susceptibility to H. pylori infection and excess gastric acid secretion. The role of potential H. pylori virulence factors not present in all strains such as the cagA gene and the results of other molecular methods to identify disease‐specific differences among isolates was also reviewed. Although cure of H. pylori infection resolves gastrin releasing peptide stimulated acid secretion there was no change in parietal cell mass. Twin studies have shown genetic differences in H. pylori susceptibility. There was no difference in the prevalence of the cagA gene between H. pylori infected asymptomatic volunteers and duodenal ulcer patients (P= 1.0). DNA‐DNA hybridization of whole genomic DNA in solution and cluster analysis of rep‐PCR genomic DNA fingerprints suggest that isolates from patients with duodenal ulcer disease are different from those obtained from individuals with asymptomatic gastritis. Cluster analysis of the rep‐PCR DNA fingerprints revealed two major groups of the strains; one set consisted of strains from patients with duodenal ulcer disease and the second cluster consisted largely of strains from individuals with asymptomatic gastritis. Recent molecular studies suggest that disease‐specific cell lineages or strains may exist among H. pylori isolates leading to the various outcomes observed in patients with H. pylori infection.
Tobacco root endophytic arthrobacter harbors genomic features enabling the catabolism of host-specific plant specialized metabolites. Plant roots constitute the primary interface between plants and soilborne microorganisms and harbor microbial communities called the root microbiota. Recent studies have demonstrated a significant contribution of plant specialized metabolites (PSMs) to the assembly of root microbiota. However, the mechanistic and evolutionary details underlying the PSM-mediated microbiota assembly and its contribution to host specificity remain elusive. Here, we show that the bacterial genus Arthrobacter is predominant specifically in the tobacco endosphere and that its enrichment in the tobacco endosphere is partially mediated by a combination of two unrelated classes of tobacco-specific PSMs, santhopine and nicotine. We isolated and sequenced Arthrobacter strains from tobacco roots as well as soils treated with these PSMs and identified genomic features, including but not limited to genes for santhopine and nicotine catabolism, that are associated with the ability to colonize tobacco roots. Phylogenomic and comparative analyses suggest that these genes were gained in multiple independent acquisition events, each of which was possibly triggered by adaptation to particular soil environments. Taken together, our findings illustrate a cooperative role of a combination of PSMs in mediating plant species-specific root bacterial micro-biota assembly and suggest that the observed interaction between tobacco and Arthrobacter may be a consequence of an ecological fitting process. IMPORTANCE Host secondary metabolites have a crucial effect on the taxonomic composition of its associated microbiota. It is estimated that a single plant species produces hundreds of secondary metabolites; however, whether different classes of metabolites have distinctive or common roles in the microbiota assembly remains unclear. Here, we show that two unrelated classes of secondary metabolites in tobacco play a cooperative role in the formation of tobacco-specific compositions of the root bacterial microbiota, which has been established as a consequence of independent evolutionary events in plants and bacteria triggered by different ecological effects. Our findings illustrate mechanistic and evolutionary aspects of the microbiota assembly that are mediated by an arsenal of plant secondary metabolites.
Entrapment of fluorescent signaling DNA aptamers in sol-gel-derived silica. We report on the first successful immobilization of a DNA aptamer, in particular, a fluorescence-signaling DNA aptamer, within a sol-gel-derived matrix. The specific aptamer examined in this study undergoes a structural switch in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to release a dabcyl-labeled nucleotide strand (QDNA), which in turn relieves the quenching of a fluorescein label that is also present in the aptamer structure. It was demonstrated that aptamers containing a complementary QDNA strand along with either a short complimentary strand bearing fluorescein (tripartite structure) or a directly bound fluorescein moiety (bipartite structure) remained intact upon entrapment within biocompatible sol-gel derived materials and retained binding activity, structure-switching capabilities, and fluorescence signal generation that was selective and sensitive to ATP concentration. Studies were undertaken to evaluate the properties of the immobilized aptamers that were either in their native state or bound to streptavidin using a terminal biotin group on the aptamer, including response time, accessibility, and leaching. Furthermore, signaling abilities were optimized through evaluation of different QDNA constructs. These studies indicated that the aptamers remained in a state that was similar to solution, with moderate leaching, only minor decreases in accessibility to ATP, and an expected reduction in response time due to diffusional barriers to mass transport of the analyte through the silica matrix. Entrapment of the aptamer also resulted in protection of the DNA against degradation from nucleases, improving the potential for use of the aptamer for in vivo sensing. This work demonstrates that sol-gel-derived materials can be used to successfully immobilize and protect DNA-based biorecognition elements and, in particular, DNA aptamers, opening new possibilities for the development of DNA aptamer-based devices, such as affinity columns, microarrays, and fiber-optic sensors.
Swarming and pathogenicity of Proteus mirabilis in the urinary tract. Proteus mirabilis is best known for its pattern of swarming differentiation on agar plates, as well as for its association with the development of renal stones in patients with urinary tract infection. Urease and flagella appear to contribute most significantly to virulence, with fimbriae playing a more subtle role, whereas hemolysin does not appear to contribute significantly to pathogenesis.
Anthocyanin profile and antioxidant activity from 24 grape varieties cultivated in two Portuguese wine regions. Aims: The purpose of this work was to evaluate the general phenolic composition and the anthocyanin profile of 24 grape varieties from two Portuguese wine regions as well as their antioxidant activity in the different grape berry fractions (skins, pulps and seeds). Methods and results: Individual anthocyanin composition of grape skin extracts was analyzed by HPLC, whereas total antioxidant activity was evaluated by two methods: DPPH and ABTS. In general, a high variability was found among the different autochthonous and non-autochthonous grape varieties in relation to the polyphenolic compounds analyzed, especially the individual anthocyanins. The individual anthocyanins in grape skin extracts were mainly malvidin (1.40-7.09 mg/g of skin), in particular malvidin-3-glucoside (0.62-6.09 mg/g of skin). The highest antioxidant activity was consistently detected in the seed extracts; however, it was not possible to establish a clear difference among the grape varieties analyzed. Conclusion: High variability in polyphenolic content, individual anthocyanin composition and antioxidant activity was found among the diverse autochthonous and nonautochthonous grape varieties studied. Seeds showed the highest antioxidant activity, followed by skin and pulp, irrespective of the grape variety. Significance and impact of the study: Most vineyards in Portugal grow Portuguese cultivare of Vitis Vinifera L. and other cultivare grown worldwide. The phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity of these grape cultivare have never been characterized under the environmental conditions of the Douro and Dão regions. The variability in phenolic content among the grape varieties studied confirms the hypothesis that genetic factors have an important role in the biosynthesis of these compounds and, consequently, in the antioxidant activity of grapes.
Generic relationships of Parashorea chinensis Wang Hsie (Dipterocarpaceae) based on cpDNA sequences. The systematic position of Parashorea chinensis (Dipterocarpaceae) was investigated by using maximum parsimony analysis of nucleotide sequences of matK, trnL intron, and trnL-trnF intergenic spacer region of chloroplast DNA. Previous studies have placed the taxon in Parashorea or Shorea. Analyses indicate that P. chinensis belongs within Parashorea (80% bootstrap) rather than within Shorea. Furthermore, P. chinensis Wang Hsie and P. chinensis Wang Hsie var. kwangsiensis Lin Chi are further confirmed to be the same taxon
High-throughput, algorithmic determination of pore parameters from electron microscopy. For the determination of magnesium alloys pore parameters in electron microscopy, a powerful and flexible platform was built, which was based on machine learning and parallel algorithms. This allows one to describe porosity, pore diameter and pore spacing accurately and quantitatively. The platform performs orders of magnitude faster after recording the image acquisition process and even during image acquisition. Automated analysis can provide strong support for high-throughput characterization techniques, and improve efficiency, accuracy, and repeatability significantly compared to manual analysis. The algorithm is a promising way to calculate the porosity much more faster and efficient.
Cooperative recruitment of dynamin and BIN/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain-containing proteins leads to GTP-dependent membrane scission. Dynamin mediates various membrane fission events, including the scission of clathrin-coated vesicles. Here, we provide direct evidence for cooperative membrane recruitment of dynamin with the BIN/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) proteins, endophilin and amphiphysin. Surprisingly, endophilin and amphiphysin recruitment to membranes was also dependent on binding to dynamin due to auto-inhibition of BAR-membrane interactions. Consistent with reciprocal recruitment in vitro,dynaminrecruitment to the plasma membrane in cells was strongly reduced by concomitant depletion of endophilin and amphiphysin, and conversely, depletion of dynamin dramatically reduced the recruitment of endophilin. In addition, amphiphysin depletion was observed to severely inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, GTP-dependent membrane scission by dynamin was dramatically elevated by BAR domain proteins. Thus, BAR domain proteins and dynamin act in synergy in membrane recruitment and GTP-dependent vesicle scission.
Effect of glutamine on the growth performance, digestive enzyme activity, absorption function, and mRNA expression of intestinal transporters in heat-stressed chickens. To explore the effect of glutamine (Gln) on the growth performance, digestive enzyme activity, absorption function and mRNA expression of intestinal transporters in heat-stressed chickens, 540 21-day-old Arbor Acres broilers were randomly assigned to a control group (no stress, NS), Gln group (Chickens were administered 0.5% and 1.0% Gln, respectively), heat stress group (HT), and Gln + HT group (Chickens were administered 0.5% and 1.0% Gln, respectively). The chickens in the HT and Gln + HT groups were reared under HT (36 ± 1 °C for 10 h/d and 22 ± 1 °C for 14 h/d), for 21 days. In contrast to the NS group, heat stress caused a reduction in the body weight gain (BWG); feed intake (FI); activity of trypsin, lipase, alkaline phosphatases, Ca2+ and Mg2+ adenosine triphosphatases, and Na+-K+-ATPase; and content of glutathione and d-xylose (P < 0.05) in the other groups. In addition, compared to the F:G and expression levels in the NS group, the heat stress increased the feed intake:body weight gain (F:G) and mRNA expression levels of SGLT1, CaBP-D28k, and L-GSBP (P < 0.05). Furthermore, HT-challenged birds were pretreated with Gln, the BWG; FI; activity of trypsin, lipase, alkaline phosphatase, Ca2+ and Mg2+ adenosine triphosphatases, and Na+-K+-ATPase; and content of glutathione and d-xylose (P < 0.05) were dramatically increased, but it decreased the F:G and mRNA expression levels of SGLT1, CaBP-D28k, and L-GSBP (P < 0.05) in the HT group. In summary, Gln can effectively improve growth performance and may promote digestion and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract by mediating the mRNA expression level of nutrient transporters and Gln metabolism in heat-stressed broilers.
A new feature selection method based on feature distinguishing ability and network influence. The occurrence and development of diseases are related to the dysfunction of biomolecules (genes, metabolites, etc.) and the changes of molecule interactions. Identifying the key molecules related to the physiological and pathological changes of organisms from omics data is of great significance for disease diagnosis, early warning and drug-target prediction, etc. A novel feature selection algorithm based on the feature individual distinguishing ability and feature influence in the biological network (FS-DANI) is proposed for defining important biomolecules (features) to discriminate different disease conditions. The feature individual distinguishing ability is evaluated based on the overlapping area of the feature effective ranges in different classes. FS-DANI measures the feature network influence based on the module importance in the correlation network and the feature centrality in the modules. The feature comprehensive weight is obtained by combining the feature individual distinguishing ability and feature influence in the network. Then crucial feature subset is determined by the sequential forward search (SFS) on the feature list sorted according to the comprehensive weights of features. FS-DANI is compared with the six efficient feature selection methods on ten public omics datasets. The ablation experiment is also conducted. Experimental results show that FS-DANI is better than the compared algorithms in accuracy, sensitivity and specificity on the whole. On analyzing the gastric cancer miRNA expression data, FS-DANI identified two miRNAs (hsa-miR-18a* and hsa-miR-381), whose AUCs for distinguishing gastric cancer samples and normal samples are 0.959 and 0.879 in the discovery set and an independent validation set, respectively. Hence, evaluating biomolecules from the molecular level and network level is helpful for identifying the potential disease biomarkers of high performance.
A pathway for repair of NAD(P)H in plants. Unwanted enzyme side reactions and spontaneous decomposition of metabolites can lead to a build-up of compounds that compete with natural enzyme substrates and must be dealt with for efficient metabolism. It has recently been realized that there are enzymes that process such compounds, formulating the concept of metabolite repair. NADH and NADPH are vital cellular redox cofactors but can form non-functional hydrates (named NAD(P)HX) spontaneously or enzymatically that compete with enzymes dependent on NAD(P)H, impairing normal enzyme function. Here we report on the functional characterization of components of a potential NAD(P)H repair pathway in plants comprising a stereospecific dehydratase (NNRD) and an epimerase (NNRE), the latter being fused to a vitamin B6 salvage enzyme. Through the use of the recombinant proteins, we show that the ATP-dependentNNRDandNNREact concomitantly to restore NAD(P)HX to NAD(P)H. NNRD behaves as a tetramer andNNREas a dimer, but the proteinsdonot physically interact. In vivo fluorescence analysis demonstrates that the proteins are localized to mitochondria and/or plastids, implicating these as the key organelles where this repair is required. Expression analysis indicates that whereas NNRE is present ubiquitously, NNRD is restricted to seeds but appears to be dispensable during the normal Arabidopsis life cycle.
Conservation of epigenetic regulation, ORC binding and developmental timing of dna replication origins in the genus Drosophila. There is much interest in how DNA replication origins are regulated so that the genome is completely duplicated each cell division cycle and in how the division of cells is spatially and temporally integrated with development. In the Drosophila melanogaster ovary, the cell cycle of somatic follicle cells is modified at precise times in oogenesis. Follicle cells first proliferate via a canonical mitotic division cycle and then enter an endocycle, resulting in their polyploidization. They subsequently enter a specialized amplification phase during which only a few, select origins repeatedly initiate DNA replication, resulting in gene copy number increases at several loci important for eggshell synthesis. Here we investigate the importance of these modified cell cycles for oogenesis by determining whether they have been conserved in evolution. We find that their developmental timing has been strictly conserved among Drosophila species that have been separate for ∼40 million years of evolution and provide evidence that additional gene loci may be amplified in some species. Further, we find that the acetylation of nucleosomes and Orc2 protein binding at active amplification origins is conserved. Conservation of DNA subsequences within amplification origins from the 12 recently sequenced Drosophila species genomes implicates members of a Myb protein complex in recruiting acetylases to the origin. Our findings suggest that conserved developmental mechanisms integrate egg chamber morphogenesis with cell cycle modifications and the epigenetic regulation of origins.
Regulatory mechanism of the three-component system HptRSA in glucose-6-phosphate uptake in Staphylococcus aureus. Glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) is a common alternative carbon source for various bacteria, and its uptake usually relies on the hexose phosphate antiporter UhpT. In the human pathogenic bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, the ability to utilize different nutrients, particularly alternative carbon source uptake in glucose-limiting conditions, is essential for its fitness in the host environment during the infectious process. It has been reported that G6P uptake in S. aureus is regulated by the three-component system HptRSA. When G6P is provided as the only carbon source, HptRSA could sense extracellular G6P and activate uhpT expression to facilitate G6P utilization. However, the regulatory mechanism of HptRSA is still unclear. In this study, we further investigated the HptRSA system in S. aureus. First, we confirmed that HptRSA is necessary for the normal growth of this pathogen in chemically defined medium with G6P supplementation, and we discovered that HptRSA could exclusively sense extracellular G6P compared to the other organophosphates we tested. Next, using isothermal titration calorimetry, we found that HptA could bind to G6P, suggesting that it may be the G6P sensor. After that experiment, using an electrophoresis mobility shift assay, we verified that the response regulator HptR could directly bind to the uhpT promoter and identified a putative binding site from −67 to −96-bp. Subsequently, we created different point mutations in the putative binding site and revealed that the entire 30-bp sequence is essential for HptR regulation. In summary, we unveiled the regulatory mechanism of the HptRSA system in S. aureus, HptA most likely functions as the G6P sensor, and HptR could implement its regulatory function by directly binding to a conserved, approximately 30-bp sequence in the uhpT promoter.
QTL analysis of moderate drought response in a rye recombinant inbred line (RIL) population shows co-localization of QTLs for morphological and physiological traits. The study aimed to identify the loci responsible for some morphological traits, induced by drought in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of rye and to find out their connections with loci for other traits, using high density, consensus, genetic map. Twenty-five QTLs engaged in the response to drought (drought index, DI) of four morphological traits were detected. Thirteen QTLs induced by drought stress co-localized with QTLs for morphology, leaf rolling, pre-harvest sprouting (PHS), alpha-amylase activity and heading earliness. XrPt507374 from 3R was found to be the most validated marker, as the nearest one to the LOD peak of QTLs for five different traits: TGW-DI, plant height, spike length, spike compactness and PHS. Three genes were considered putative candidate genes for drought response on the basis of sequence alignment of DArTs linked to QTLs from 5R: DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA helicase, thaumatin-like protein precursor (TLP) and transcription initiation factor TFIID.
The making of gametes in higher plants. Higher plants have evolved to be one of the predominant life forms on this planet. A great deal of this evolutionary success relies in a very short gametophytic phase which underlies the sexual reproduction cycle. Sexual plant reproduction takes place in special organs of the flower. In most species the processes of gametogenesis, pollination, syngamy and embryogenesis are sequentially coordinated to give rise to a functional seed in a matter of few weeks. Any of these processes is so intricately complex and precisely regulated that it becomes no wonder that each involves more specific genes and cellular processes than any other function in the plant life cycle. While variability generation - the evolutionary output of the sexual cycle - is the same as in any other Kingdom, plants do it using a completely original set of mechanisms, many of which are not yet comprehended. In this paper, we cover the fundamental features of male and female gametogenesis. While the physiological and cellular bases of these processes have been continuously described since the early nineteen century, recent usage of Arabidopsis and other species as central models has brought about a great deal of specific information regarding their genetic regulation. Transcriptomics has recently enlarged the repertoire and pollen became the first gametophyte to have a fully described transcriptome in plants. We thus place special emphasis on the way this newly accumulated genetic and transcriptional information impacts our current understanding of the mechanisms of gametogenesis.
GC–MS, FTIR and Raman Analysis of Antioxidant Components of Red Pigments from Stemphylium lycopersici. Many microorganisms can generate pigments with different colours and structures during the growth process. In this study, an endophytic fungus producing red pigments was isolated from Cynanchum auriculatum Royle ex Wight tissue. PCR amplification sequencing was conducted, and phylogenetic analysis was performed on the ITS region sequences. Combined with morphological observation, the fungus was identified as Stemphylium lycopersici. The antioxidant activities of the pigments were evaluated in vitro and showed good antioxidant properties. Ultraviolet (UV), Raman, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC–MS) were used to analyse the pigments’ components, which were shown to contain phenolics and anthraquinones. Most of these components have not been previously reported in Stemphylium lycopersici, especially physcione. This study is the first report of Stemphylium lycopersici secondary metabolites and their potential use as red pigments and antioxidants. Further optimisation of the culture conditions of this fungal strain might permit its application for pigment production.
Metatranscriptomic and metabolite profiling reveals vertical heterogeneity within a Zygnema green algal mat from Svalbard (High Arctic). Within streptophyte green algae Zygnematophyceae are the sister group to the land plants that inherited several traits conferring stress protection. Zygnema sp., a mat-forming alga thriving in extreme habitats, was collected from a field site in Svalbard, where the bottom layers are protected by the top layers. The two layers were investigated by a metatranscriptomic approach and GC–MS-based metabolite profiling. In the top layer, 6569 genes were significantly upregulated and 149 were downregulated. Upregulated genes coded for components of the photosynthetic apparatus, chlorophyll synthesis, early light-inducible proteins, cell wall and carbohydrate metabolism, including starch-degrading enzymes. An increase in maltose in the top layer and degraded starch grains at the ultrastructural levels corroborated these findings. Genes involved in amino acid, redox metabolism and DNA repair were upregulated. A total of 29 differentially accumulated metabolites (out of 173 identified ones) confirmed higher metabolic turnover in the top layer. For several of these metabolites, differential accumulation matched the transcriptional changes of enzymes involved in associated pathways. In summary, the findings support the hypothesis that in a Zygnema mat the top layer shields the bottom layers from abiotic stress factors such as excessive irradiation.
'Applying speech technologies to assess verbal memory in patients with serious mental illness. Verbal memory deficits are some of the most profound neurocognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia and serious mental illness in general. As yet, their measurement in clinical settings is limited to traditional tests that allow for limited administrations and require substantial resources to deploy and score. Therefore, we developed a digital ambulatory verbal memory test with automated scoring, and repeated self-administration via smart devices. One hundred and four adults participated, comprising 25 patients with serious mental illness and 79 healthy volunteers. The study design was successful with high quality speech recordings produced to 92% of prompts (Patients: 86%, Healthy: 96%). The story recalls were both transcribed and scored by humans, and scores generated using natural language processing on transcriptions were comparable to human ratings (R = 0.83, within the range of human-to-human correlations of R = 0.73–0.89). A fully automated approach that scored transcripts generated by automatic speech recognition produced comparable and accurate scores (R = 0.82), with very high correlation to scores derived from human transcripts (R = 0.99). This study demonstrates the viability of leveraging speech technologies to facilitate the frequent assessment of verbal memory for clinical monitoring purposes in psychiatry.
Regulated expression of a novel TCP domain transcription factor indicates an involvement in the control of meristem activation processes in Solanum tuberosum. In this study, the aim was to determine whether TCP transcription factors are implicated in meristem activation in potato (Solanum tuberosum). By searching a database of potato EST sequences, with a sequence characteristically conserved in TCP domains, a potato top gene was identified. A BAC clone containing the top sequence was isolated and the genomic sequence was determined. Using a CAPS marker assay, the potato top gene (sttcp1) was mapped to chromosome 8. In dormant buds, relatively high levels of sttcp1-specific transcript were detected by in situ hybridization. By contrast, in sprouting buds, no expression of the sttcp1 could be detected. Furthermore, an inverse relationship between axillary bud size and the steady-state level of the sstcp1 transcript was demonstrated. In non-growing buds exhibiting correlative inhibition, sttcp1-specific transcript levels were also relatively high, but rapidly decreased when apical dominance was removed by excision of the apical bud.
Genetic diversity in in vitro-conserved germplasm of Curcuma L. as revealed by RAPD markers. A set of 30 accessions of five Curcuma species-C. latifolia, C. malabarica, C. manga and C. raktakanta and 13 morphotypes (identified on the basis of morphological markers) of C. longa conserved in the In Vitro Genebank at National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources, New Delhi, were subjected to RAPD analysis. Of the 200 RAPD primers screened, 21 polymorphic primers were selected for further study. Mean genetic similarities based on Jaccard's similarity coefficient ranged from 0.18 to 0.86 in accessions of cultivated species, i.e., C. longa and from 0.25 to 0.86 in wild species. The dendrogram derived from the RAPD data corroborated the morphological classification of the morphotypes. The efficiency of individual RAPD primers was also compared; primers OPC-20, OPO-06, OPC-01 and OPL-03 were adjudged highly informative in discriminating the germplasm of Curcuma.
Plant autophagy: new flavors on the menu. Autophagy mediates the delivery of cytoplasmic content to vacuoles or lysosomes for degradation or storage. The best characterized autophagy route called macroautophagy involves the sequestration of cargo in double-membrane autophagosomes and is conserved in eukaryotes, including plants. Recently, several new receptors, some of them plant-specific, that select cargo for macroautophagy have been identified. Some of these receptors appear to participate in regulation of competing catabolic pathways, for example proteasome-mediated versus autophagic degradation under specific stress conditions. Vacuolar microautophagy, a process by which the vacuole directly engulf cytoplasmic material, also occurs in plants but its underlying molecular mechanisms are yet to be elucidated.
Toxicity testing in the 21st century: A vision and a strategy. With the release of the landmark report Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy, the U.S. , in 2007, precipitated a major change in the way toxicity testing is conducted. It envisions increased efficiency in toxicity testing and decreased animal usage by transitioning from current expensive and lengthy in vivo testing with qualitative endpoints to in vitro toxicity pathway assays on human cells or cell lines using robotic high-throughput screening with mechanistic quantitative parameters. Risk assessment in the exposed human population would focus on avoiding significant perturbations in these toxicity pathways. Computational systems biology models would be implemented to determine the dose-response models of perturbations of pathway function. Extrapolation of in vitro results to in vivo human blood and tissue concentrations would be based on pharmacokinetic models for the given exposure condition. This practice would enhance human relevance of test results, and would cover several test agents, compared to traditional toxicological testing strategies. As all the tools that are necessary to implement the vision are currently available or in an advanced stage of development, the key prerequisites to achieving this paradigm shift are a commitment to change in the scientific community, which could be facilitated by a broad discussion of the vision, and obtaining necessary resources to enhance current knowledge of pathway perturbations and pathway assays in humans and to implement computational systems biology models. Implementation of these strategies would result in a new toxicity testing paradigm firmly based on human biology.
Autonomous expression of the nic1 acetylcholine receptor mutation in zebrafish muscle cells. The nic1b107 (nic1) mutation blocks expression of both functional and clustered acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in zebrafish muscle. Normally, signaling between motoneurons and muscles regulates AChR clustering. To learn if signaling is affected and to identify the primary cellular target of the nic1 mutation, we made mosaic embryos by transplanting motoneurons and muscle precursors from wild-type to mutant embryos. Genotypically mutant muscle cells fail to cluster AChRs even when contacted by wild-type motoneurons, whereas genotypically mutant motoneurons induce AChR clustering on wild-type muscle cells. Moreover, mutant muscle cells fail to cluster AChRs under culture conditions that induce AChR clustering on wild-type cells. We conclude that the nic1 mutation acts autonomously in muscle cells rather than by affecting signaling between motoneurons and muscle. The wild-type nic1 gene is necessary in muscle for expression and clustering of AChRs.
The flavonoid biosynthetic enzyme chalcone isomerase modulates terpenoid production in glandular trichomes of tomato. Flavonoids and terpenoids are derived from distinct metabolic pathways but nevertheless serve complementary roles in mediating plant interactions with the environment. Here, we show that glandular trichomes of the anthocyanin free (af) mutant of cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fail to accumulate both flavonoids and terpenoids. This pleiotropic metabolic deficiency was associated with loss of resistance to native populations of coleopteran herbivores under field conditions. We demonstrate that Af encodes an isoform (SlCHI1) of the flavonoid biosynthetic enzyme chalcone isomerase (CHI), which catalyzes the conversion of naringenin chalcone to naringenin and is strictly required for flavonoid production in multiple tissues of tomato. Expression of the wild-type SlCHI1 gene from its native promoter complemented the anthocyanin deficiency in af. Unexpectedly, the SlCHI1 transgene also complemented the defect in terpenoid production in glandular trichomes. Our results establish a key role for SlCHI1 in flavonoid production in tomato and reveal a link between CHI1 and terpenoid production. Metabolic coordination of the flavonoid and terpenoid pathways may serve to optimize the function of trichome glands in dynamic environments.
Analysis of the microbial communities on corroded concrete sewer pipes - A case study. Conventional as well as molecular techniques have been used to determine the microbial communities present on the concrete walls of sewer pipes. The genetic fingerprint of the microbiota on corroded concrete sewer pipes was obtained by means of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA gene fragments. The DGGE profiles of the bacterial communities present on the concrete surface changed as observed by shifts occurring at the level of the dominance of bands from non-corroded places to the most severely corroded places. By means of statistical tools, it was possible to distinguish two different groups, corresponding to the microbial communities on corroded and non-corroded surfaces, respectively. Characterization of the microbial communities indicated that the sequences of typical bands showed the highest level of identity to sequences from the bacterial strains Thiobacillus thiooxidans, Acidithio-bacillus sp., Mycobacterium sp. and different heterotrophs belonging to the α-, β- and γ-Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria. In addition, the presence of N-acyl-homoserine lactone signal molecules was shown by two bio-assays of the biofilm on the concrete under the water level and at the most severely corroded places on the concrete surface of the sewer pipe.
GmTDN1 improves wheat yields by inducing dual tolerance to both drought and low-N stress. Genetically enhancing drought tolerance and nutrient use efficacy enables sustainable and stable wheat production in drought-prone areas exposed to water shortages and low soil fertility, due to global warming and declining natural resources. In this study, wheat plants, exhibiting improved drought tolerance and N-use efficacy, were developed by introducing GmTDN1, a gene encoding a DREB-like transcription factor, into two modern winter wheat varieties, cv Shi4185 and Jimai22. Overexpressing GmTDN1 in wheat resulted in significantly improved drought and low-N tolerance under drought and N-deficient conditions in the greenhouse. Field trials conducted at three different locations over a period of 2–3 consecutive years showed that both Shi4185 and Jimai22 GmTDN1 transgenic lines were agronomically superior to wild-type plants, and produced significantly higher yields under both drought and N-deficient conditions. No yield penalties were observed in these transgenic lines under normal well irrigation conditions. Overexpressing GmTDN1 enhanced photosynthetic and osmotic adjustment capacity, antioxidant metabolism, and root mass of wheat plants, compared to those of wild-type plants, by orchestrating the expression of a set of drought stress-related genes as well as the nitrate transporter, NRT2.5. Furthermore, transgenic wheat with overexpressed NRT2.5 can improve drought tolerance and nitrogen (N) absorption, suggesting that improving N absorption in GmTDN1 transgenic wheat may contribute to drought tolerance. These findings may lead to the development of new methodologies with the capacity to simultaneously improve drought tolerance and N-use efficacy in cereal crops to ensure sustainable agriculture and global food security.
Characterization of the mitochondrial genome of the diamondback moth plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) and phylogenetic analysis of advanced moths and butterflies. Here we determined the mitochondrial genome sequence of a notorious pest, the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutoidea: Plutellidae). The mitochondrial genome contains 37 typical animal mitochondrial genes and an A+T-rich region. The gene arrangement is identical to that of other ditrysian lepidopteran mitochondrial genomes, but different from the ancestral gene arrangement in the non-ditrysian Hepialidae of Lepidoptera. The start codon of the cox1 gene is CGA, which is dissimilar to its homologs in most other insects. In Lepidoptera, cox1 and cox2 have low nucleotide diversities, while the nad6, nad2, and nad3 genes are highly variable. Phylogenetic analyses uncovered the reciprocal monophyly of Ditrysia, Apoditrysia, Obtectomera, and Macrolepidoptera, and the placement of the Hesperiidae within Papilionoidea. Our analyses suggest that the complete mitochondrial genome sequences are a promising marker toward fully resolving the phylogenetic relationships within Lepidoptera.
Prevalence and Molecular Characterization of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus from Nasal Specimens: Overcoming MRSA with Silver Nanoparticles and Their Applications. Staphylococcus aureus is a cause of high mortality in humans and therefore it is necessary to prevent its transmission and reduce infections. Our goals in this research were to investigate the frequency of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in Taif, Saudi Arabia, and assess the relationship between the phenotypic antimicrobial sensitivity patterns and the genes responsible for resistance. In addition, we examined the antimicrobial efficiency and application of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) against MRSA isolates. Seventy-two nasal swabs were taken from patients; MRSA was cultivated on Mannitol Salt Agar supplemented with methicillin, and 16S rRNA sequencing was conducted in addition to morphological and biochemical identification. Specific resistance genes such as ermAC, aacA-aphD, tetKM, vatABC and mecA were PCR-amplified and resistance plasmids were also investigated. The MRSA incidence was ~49 % among the 72 S. aureus isolates and all MRSA strains were resistant to oxacillin, penicillin, and cefoxitin. However, vancomycin, linezolid, teicoplanin, mupirocin, and rifampicin were effective against 100% of MRSA strains. About 61% of MRSA strains exhibited multidrug resistance and were resistant to 3-12 antimicrobial medications (MDR). Methicillin resistance gene mecA was presented in all MDR-MRSA strains. Most MDR-MRSA contained a plasmid of > 10 kb. To overcome bacterial resistance, AgNPs were applied and displayed high antimicrobial activity and synergistic effect with penicillin. Our findings may help establish programs to control bacterial spread in communities as AgNPs appeared to exert a synergistic effect with penicillin to control bacterial resistance.
Formation of branched DNA structures by Xenopus laevis oocyte extract. WE have reported that a soluble cell-free extract from stage 6 oocytes of Xenopus laevis can act on supercoiled SV40 DNA to produce molecules with a single-strand scission, linear molecules of full length, shorter fragments and various forms of complex DNA1. The complex DNA consisted of various structures, such as figure-of-eight dimers, catenated dimers, circular dimers, catenated trimers, late Cairns' structures, complex multimers and circular monomers with tails. The few late Cairns' structures observed could have been due to replication, but it is possible that they and the other forms of complex DNA resulted from recombination among SV40 DNA molecules. We thought that fractionation of the extract should produce fractions lacking some of the activities necessary to produce complex DNA, so that intermediate structures would accumulate. We now report that some fractions of the extract produce a high percentage of branched DNA structures from SV40 DNA, and we describe the requirements and characteristics of this reaction. We also discuss the possibility that branched DNA is an intermediate in the formation of complex DNA.
Rapid one-step protein purification from plant material using the eight-amino acid StrepII epitope. Beyond the rewards of plant genome analysis and gene identification, characterisation of protein activities, post-translational modifications and protein complex composition remains a challenge for plant biologists. Ideally, methods should allow rapid isolation of proteins from plant material achieving a high degree of purity. We tested three purification strategies based on the eight-amino acid StrepII, six-amino acid His6 and 181-amino acid Tandem Affinity Purification (TAP) affinity tags for enrichment of a membrane-anchored protein kinase, NtCDPK2, and a soluble protein, AtSGT1b, from leaf extracts. Transiently expressed StrepII-tagged NtCDPK2 was purified from Nicotiana benthamiana to almost complete homogeneity in less than 60 min and was directly suitable for enzymatic or mass-spectrometric analyses, allowing the identification of in planta phosphorylation sites. In contrast, purification of NtCDPK2 via His6 tag yielded partially oxidised protein of low purity. AtSGT1b could be isolated after transient expression from N. benthamiana or from transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana as either TAP-tagged or StrepII-tagged protein. While StrepII-tag purification achieved similar yield and high purity as the TAP-tag strategy, it was considerably easier and faster. Using either tagging strategy, a protein was co-purified with AtSGT1b from N. benthaniana and A. thaliana leaf extracts, suggesting that both the StrepII and TAP tags are suitable for purification of protein complexes from plant material. We propose that the StrepII epitope, in particular, may serve as a generally utilizable tag to further our understanding of protein functions, post-translational modifications and interaction dynamics in plants.
Two DNA barcodes and morphology for multi-method species delimitation in Bonnetina tarantulas (Araneae: Theraphosidae). Determining species boundaries is a central debate in biology. Several recently developed molecular delimitation methods have highlighted extensive inconsistency in classical morphological taxonomy. However, choosing between them is contentious. Molecular studies on theraphosid spiders have found considerable cryptic diversity and many species redundantly described. Most of these studies have relied only on COI, a mitochondrial marker that has proven its efficacy in animal studies, but which also might lead to an over-estimation of diversity.Here we present an integrative approach to species delimitation in Bonnetina, a poorly known group of tarantulas endemic to Mexico. We employed morphological evidence, as well as different setups with distance-based (Hard-Gap barcoding and ABGD) and tree-based (GMYC, PTP and BPP) molecular barcoding approaches, using one mitochondrial (COI) and one nuclear (ITS1) rapidly evolving loci. BPP is also used as a multi-locus method. We also explored the influence of ambiguous alignment choice and of coding gaps as characters in phylogenetic inference and in species delimitation with that marker.Different delimitation methods with COI gave moderately variable results and this gene exhibited a universal barcode gap. The ITS1 gene tree was well supported and robust to alignment choice; with this locus, coding gaps improved branch support and species delimitation with PTP. No universal barcode gap was found with ITS1, and single locus delimitations returned disparate results. However, this locus helped to highlight cases of under- and overestimations by COI. BPP gave solutions with many lineages, in single locus and combined analyses, especially with the recently implemented unguided methodology. We recognize 12 robustly supported species in our data set, of which seven remain undescribed, and three are morphologically cryptic. For COI Bonnetina species identification, we propose intra- and inter-specific thresholds of 2% and 6% sequence divergence, respectively.We conclude that morphological signal for species delimitation in Bonnetina is higher than for other studied tarantulas, but it fails to recognize several lineages in the genus. COI is a functional barcoding marker, and the most reliable source of evidence that we used, but it may also lead to inaccurate delimitations. ITS1 is a highly informative locus for species delimitation and species-level phylogeny, but it performs poorly as a barcoding marker. Due to variability between delimitation methods, we suggest combining evidence from multiple approaches to get better-supported results.
Classification and prediction of toxicity of chemicals using an automated phenotypic profiling of Caenorhabditis elegans. Background: Traditional toxicological studies have relied heavily on various animal models to understand the effect of various compounds in a biological context. Considering the great cost, complexity and time involved in experiments using higher order organisms. Researchers have been exploring alternative models that avoid these disadvantages. One example of such a model is the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. There are some advantages of C. elegans, such as small size, short life cycle, well defined genome, ease of maintenance and efficient reproduction. Methods: As these benefits allow large scale studies to be initiated with relative ease, the problem of how to efficiently capture, organize and analyze the resulting large volumes of data must be addressed. We have developed a new method for quantitative screening of chemicals using C. elegans. 33 features were identified for each chemical treatment. Results: The compounds with different toxicities were shown to alter the phenotypes of C. elegans in distinct and detectable patterns. We found that phenotypic profiling revealed conserved functions to classify and predict the toxicity of different chemicals. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the power of phenotypic profiling in C. elegans under different chemical environments.
Single-strand-binding factor(s) which interact with ARS1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Since plasmids containing autonomously replicating sequence(s) (ARS) can transform Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells at high frequency, ARS are considered to be the replicanion origins of chromosomes. To study the mechanism of initiation of eukaryotic chromosomal replication, we examined protein factors which interact with the ARSI region located near the centromere of chromosome IV in S. cervisiiae. Using the gel-shift assay, we found protein factors which bound to a single-stranded, 97-bp fragment of the ARSI region containing the core consensus. Competition experiments with various oligodeoxyribonucleotides (oligos) suggest that a site recognized by the factor(s) was within the element containing the core consensus and adjacent close matches to the core consensus of the minus strand. Indeed, when the oligo containing the minus strand of this element was used as a probe, two oligo-protein complexes were detected. Mutations in the core consensus reduced these binding activities. When the plus-strand oligo of the same region was used as a probe, a retarded band was also detected, but with less specific binding. Considering the fact that the core consensus and close matches to the core consensus are important for ARS function, these results imply that the protein factors detected in this experiment may participate in DNA replication.
Contributors to and consequences of burnout among clinical genetic counselors in the United States. Prior research has found that many genetic counselors (GCs) experience burnout. Studies of other clinicians have demonstrated that burnout can have significant detrimental consequences for clinicians, patients, and the healthcare system. We sought to explore the prevalence of, contributors to, and consequences of burnout among GCs. We performed a secondary data analysis of baseline data from Me-GC, a randomized controlled trial of meditation for GCs. We applied a systems model of burnout proposed by the National Academy of Medicine (NAM), which depicts burnout arising from a combination of contributors that include both work system and individual mediating factors, and then leading to consequences. Validated self-report scales were used to measure burnout and most contributors and consequences. Female and white GCs were over-represented in our sample. Over half (57.2%) of the 397 participants had Professional Fulfillment Index scores indicative of burnout. Multiple potential contributors were associated with burnout, consistent with its known multifactorial nature. Among work system factors, higher levels of burnout were associated with insufficient administrative support, lack of autonomy, and not feeling valued by non-GC colleagues. Individual mediating factors associated with greater burnout included higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. Participants with lower levels of burnout reported greater mindfulness, resilience, and use of professional self-care behaviors. Among variables categorized as consequences, higher levels of burnout were associated with lower levels of empathy, counseling alliance, and positive unconditional regard, as well as higher reactive distress, and a greater desire to reduce the amount of time spent on clinical care. Given the prevalence and potential consequences of burnout observed here, it is imperative that the field take steps to mitigate burnout risk.
Optimization of train nose shape for reducing micro-pressure wave radiated from tunnel exit. When a compression wave generated by a high-speed train entering a tunnel propagates through the tunnel and arrives at the tunnel exit, an impulsive pressure wave (micro-pressure wave) is radiated from the tunnel exit. Improving the train nose shape is one of the techniques for suppressing the micro-pressure wave. Furthermore, tunnel entrance hoods are required for long concrete slab tunnels in order to suppress the micro-pressure wave. The effect of the tunnel entrance hood on the compression wave generated by the train can be evaluated by means of a rapid computational scheme devised and validated experimentally by Howe  In this study, the optimal longitudinal distribution of the cross-sectional area of the train nose shape was determined by using the rapid computational scheme and a genetic algorithm. The effect of the nose shape optimization was confirmed through experiments using scale models.
Hemolysin and K antigens in relation to serotype and hemagglutination type of Escherichia coli isolated from extraintestinal infections. Escherichia coli isolated from cases of bacteremia and from a variety of urinary tract infections were characterized according to serotype (O:H antigenicity), K type (possession of K1, K2, K3, K12, or K13), hemagglutination (HA) type, and production of beta-hemolysin. Results obtained with the bacteremia and urinary tract infection isolates were similar except for more hemolytic isolates from urine than from blood (42 versus 29%) and more K1+ isolates from blood than from urine (50 versus 29%). A close correlation was found between HA type VI (production of fimbriae which mediate mannose-resistant HA of human and African green monkey erythrocytes) and the production of hemolysin or K1 capsular antigen or both. Most (95 of 98, or 95%) of the HA type VI+ blood isolates and most (146 of 164, or 89%) of the HA type VI+ urine isolates produced hemolysin or K1 or both, in contrast to 22 and 26%, respectively, of those belonging to HA types other than HA type VI. Also, 76% of all hemolytic and 70% of all K1+ isolates belonged to HA type VI. Remarkably few of the HA type VI+ isolates (13%) and even fewer of the HA type VI- isolates (3%) produced both K1 and hemolysin; these belonged mainly to serotypes O16:H6, O18:H7, and O2:H4. Other major serogroups were usually K1+/hemolysin- (O1, O7) or K1-/hemolysin+ (O2, O4, O6). At least 74% (262 of 351) and possibly as many as 83% (293 of 351) of those isolates which produced mannose-resistant HA of human erythrocytes were classified as HA type VI+; 31 isolates produced mannose-resistant HA with all erythrocytes tested. Taking serogroup and serotype into consideration, we conclude that the E. coli fimbrial hemagglutinin(s) responsible for the HA type VI phenotype will prove to be the same as the virulence-associated mannose-resistant adhesins of uropathogenic E. coli which other investigators have characterized as unique fimbrial antigens detectable by mannose-resistant HA of human erythrocytes.
Transcriptional modulation of penicillin-binding protein 1b, outer membrane protein P2 and efflux pump (AcrAB-TolC) during heat stress is correlated to enhanced bactericidal action of imipenem on non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae. Objective: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the penicillin binding proteins (PBPs), drug influx and efflux modulations during heat stress and their effects on the bactericidal action of imipenem on non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). Methods: The two NTHi clinical isolates (GE47 and GE88, imipenem MICs by E-test > 32 μg/mL) examined in this study were collected at Geneva University Hospitals. The imipenem killing activity was assessed after incubation of the NTHi strains at either 37 or 42°C for 3 h with increasing concentrations of imipenem. The detection of PBPs was carried out by Bocillin-FL. Global transcriptional changes were monitored by RNA-seq after pre-incubation of bacterial cells at either 37 or 42°C, and the expression levels of relevant target genes were confirmed by qRT-PCR. Results: Quantitation of NTHi viable cells after incubation with 0.25 μg/mL of imipenem for 3 h revealed more than a twofold decrease in GE47 and GE88 viable cells at 42°C as compared to 37°C. Transcriptome analysis showed that under heat stress conditions, there were 141 differentially expressed genes with a | log2(fold change)| > 1, including 67 up-regulated and 74 down-regulated genes. The expression levels of ponB (encoding PBP1b) and acrR (regulator of AcrAB-TolC efflux pump) were significantly increased at 42°C. In contrast, the transcript levels of ompP2 (encoding the outer membrane protein P2) and acrB gene (encoding AcrB) were significantly lower under heat stress condition. Conclusion: This study shows that the transcriptional modulation of ponB, ompP2, acrR, and acrB in the heat stress response is correlated to enhanced antimicrobial effects of imipenem on non-typeable H. influenzae.
Micropropagation of newly produced F1 hybrid of Eucalyptus (E. tereticornis Sm. X E. camaldulensis Dehn. Southern form). A new F1 interspecific controlled hybrid of Eucalyptus tereticornis X Eucalyptus camaldulensis (Southern form) was produced during March, 1996 which showed hybrid vigour. Since de novo production of F1 seed for raising F1 plantation is not feasible, cumbersome and labour intensive, thus, an innovative and effective approach to multiply this hybrid via tissue culture was applied to check segregation, retain hybrid vigour and evolve a protocol for mass clonal multiplication.
Identification of potassium phosphite responsive miRNAs and their targets in potato. Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are small single strand non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, either by translational inhibition or mRNA degradation based on the extent of complementarity between the miRNA and its target mRNAs. Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the most important horticultural crop in Argentina. Achieving an integrated control of diseases is crucial for this crop, where frequent agrochemical applications, particularly fungicides, are carried out. A promising strategy is based on promoting induced resistance through the application of environmentally friendly compounds such as phosphites, inorganic salts of phosphorous acid. The use of phosphites in disease control management has proven to be effective. Although the mechanisms underlying their effect remain unclear, we postulated that miRNAs could be involved. Therefore we performed next generation sequencing (NGS) in potato leaves treated and non treated with potassium phosphite (KPhi). We identified 25 miRNAs that were expressed differentially, 14 already annotated in miRBase and 11 mapped to the potato genome as potential new miRNAs. A prediction of miRNA targets showed genes related to pathogen resistance, transcription factors, and oxidative stress. We also analyzed in silico stress and phytohormone responsive cis-acting elements on differentially expressed pre miRNAs. Despite the fact that some of the differentially expressed miRNAs have been already identified, this is to our knowledge the first report identifying miRNAs responsive to a biocompatible stress resistance inducer such as potassium phosphite, in plants. Further characterization of these miRNAs and their target genes might help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying KPhi-induced resistance.
Research progress on optimizing panicle characters and quality improvement of indica pedigree in northern japonica rice. Since the Eleventh Five Year Plan began, the northern japonica rice breeding team, headed by the Rice Research Institute of Shenyang Agricultural University, has undertaken an effort to improve the quality of northern japonica rice, with particular attention to panicle traits and regulating the indica pedigree. Remarkable progress has been made in the elucidation of the genetic and physiological basis of important agronomic traits, germplasm resource innovation, and the breeding of new varieties. (1) We found that erect panicle architecture is controlled by a dominant allele of EP1, which produces the shortened internode of the panicle, increases both the number of grains per panicle and the seed density, and eventually affects overall appearance and milling quality while improving the yield characters. We also found that the introgression of indica pedigree improved the yield potential of japonica rice, though there was a detectable quality penalty, especially in eating and cooking quality. (2) We proposed a model of ideal panicle architecture and identified effective selection indicators including panicle curvature, panicle type index, vascular bundle efficiency, primary branch efficiency, and indica pedigree introgression percentage. On this basis, we established the quantitative parameters for ideal panicle type of japonica rice in northern China (neck panicle curvature < 40°, panicle type index > 0.50, vascular bundle efficiency ≥ 0.75, primary branch efficiency ≈ 1.0, number of primary branches ≥ 15, brown rice rate ≥ 83%, head rice rate ≥ 68%, chalky rice rate ≤ 10%, taste value ≥ 80, the indica pedigree introgression at about 10%) to coordinate the balance between yield and quality, especially eating quality. (3) We have systematically summarized the results of our research, and we developed a strong theory for the improvement of the quality and technical systems of northern japonica rice by optimizing panicle traits and indica pedigree introgression. We first selected elite offspring derived from the cross between indica and japonica, and then backcrossed or double-crossed them with high-quality, high-yield japonica germplasm resources, optimized the eating and cooking quality using a directional selection of indica pedigree introgression, and narrowed the gap between superior and inferior grains through the increase in the number of panicle neck vascular bundles and primary branches to realize the synchronous improvement of milling, appearance, and eating and cooking quality on the basis of maintaining the grain yield. This research has led to a 16.60% increase in the per unit yield of japonica rice in northeastern China and a 96.88% increase in cultivation area since the beginning of the 21st century. The proportion of total yield in the country has increased from 9.51% to 17.91%, indicating a synchronous and significant improvement of cultivation area per unit yield, and grain quality. In this paper, we also discuss existing problems and directions for the development of related fields.
Dedicated Herbaceous Biomass Feedstock Genetics and Development. Biofuels and bio-based products can be produced from a wide variety of herbaceous feedstocks. To supply enough biomass to meet the needs of a new bio-based economy, a suite of dedicated biomass species must be developed to accommodate a range of growing environments throughout the USA. Researchers from the US Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) and collaborators associated with the USDA Regional Biomass Research Centers have made major progress in understanding the genetics of switchgrass, sorghum, and other grass species and have begun to use this knowledge to develop new cultivars with high yields and appropriate traits for efficient conversion to bio-based products. Plant geneticists and breeders have discovered genes that reduce recalcitrance for biochemical conversion to ethanol and drop-in fuels. Progress has also been made in finding genes that improve production under biotic and abiotic stress from diseases, pests, and climatic variations.
Expression and Function Analysis of Interleukin-17A/F1, 2, and 3 Genes in Yellow Catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco): Distinct Bioactivity of Recombinant IL-17A/F1, 2, and 3. In mammals, Interleukin-17 cytokine family plays critical roles in both acute and chronic inflammatory responses. In fish species, three Interleukin-17A/F (IL-17A/F) genes have been identified to be homologous to mammalian IL-17A and IL-17F, but little is known about their functional activity. In this study, Pf_IL-17A/F1, 2 and 3 genes were cloned from yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco) and they differed in protein structure and exon length, implying that they may have divergent bioactivity. Real-time quantitative PCR analyses revealed that three Pf_IL-17A/F genes were highly expressed in blood and mucosal tissues (skin+mucus and gill) from healthy adult fish. The mRNA expressions of Pf_IL-17A/F1, 2 and 3 genes were significantly up-regulated in the gill, skin+mucus, head kidney and spleen after challenge with Edwardsiella ictaluri and in the isolated peripheral blood leucocytes (PBLs) of yellow catfish after stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), lipopolysaccharides (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN) and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C). These results indicate that Pf_IL-17A/F1, 2 and 3 genes may play a vital role in the regulation of immune against pathogens. Additionally, the recombinant (r) Pf_IL-17A/F1, 2 and 3 proteins significantly induced the mRNA expressions of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and antibacterial peptides genes, and the rPf_IL-17A/F 2 and 3 proteins promoted phagocytosis of PBLs more powerfully than the rPf_IL-17A/F1. Furthermore, the rPf_IL-17A/F1, 2 and 3 proteins might activate the NF-κB and MAPK signal pathways by IL-17RA, ACT1, TRAF6, TRAF2, TRAF5 and TAK1, indicating that the three Pf_IL-17A/F proteins may play different roles in promoting inflammatory response.
VirD4-independent transformation by CloDF13 evidences an unknown factor required for the genetic colonization of plants via Agrobacterium. Agrobacterium uses a mechanism similar to conjugation for trans-kingdom transfer of its oncogenic T-DNA. A defined VirB/VirD4 Type IV secretion system is responsible for such a genetic transfer. In addition, certain virulence proteins as VirE2 can be mobilized into host cells by the same apparatus. VirE2 is essential to achieve plant but not yeast transformation. We found that the limited host range plasmid CloDF13 can be recruited by the virulence apparatus of Agrobacterium for transfer to eukaryotic hosts. As expected the VirB transport complex was required for such trans-kingdom DNA transfer. However, unexpectedly, the coupling factor VirD4 turned out to be necessary for transfer to plants but not for transport into yeast. The CloDF13 encoded coupling factor (Mob) was essential for transfer to both plants and yeast though. This is interpreted by the different specificities of Mob and VirD4. Hence, Mob being required for the transport of the CloDF13 transferred DNA (to both plants and yeast) and VirD4 being required for transport of virulence proteins such as VirE2. Nevertheless, the presence of the VirE2 protein in the host plant was not sufficient to restore the deficiency for VirD4 in the transforming bacteria. We propose that Mob functions encoded by the plasmid CloDF13 are sufficient for DNA mobilization to eukaryotic cells but that the VirD4-mediated pathway is essential to achieve DNA nuclear establishment specifically in plants. This suggests that other Agrobacterium virulence proteins besides VirE2 are translocated and essential for plant transformation.
Homologues of wheat ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes - TaUBC1 and TaUBC4 are encoded by small multigene families in Arabidopsis thaliana. Covalent attachment of ubiquitin to other cellular proteins has been implicated in a multitude of diverse physiological processes in eukaryotes including selective protein degradation. This attachment is carried out by a multi-enzyme pathway consisting of three classes of enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1s), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), and ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3s). E2s accept activated ubiquitin from E1 and conjugate it to target proteins with or without the participation of specific E3s. Previously, we have isolated wheat cDNAs encoding 16 and 23 kDa E2s, TaUBC1 and TaUBC4, respectively. TaUBC1 shows structural homology to the yeast RAD6 E2 that is essential for DNA repair whereas TaUBC4 is related to the yeast ScUBC8 E2, both of which effectively conjugate ubiquitin to histones in vitro but as yet are without a known in vivo function. Here, we report the isolation of genomic and cDNA homologues of these genes from Arabidopsis thaliana. In Arabidopsis, both of these E2s are encoded by three member gene families. Members of the AtUBC1 gene family, comprising AtUBC1, 2 and 3, encode 150-152 amino acid proteins that are 83-99% identical to each other and TaUBC1 and contain four introns that are conserved with respect to position. Members of the AtUBC4 gene family, comprising AtUBC4, 5 and 6, encode 187-191 amino acid proteins that are 73-88% identical to each other and TaUBC4 and contain five introns that are conserved with respect to position. In contrast, AtUBC1-3 gene products are only 31-36% identical to those derived from AtUBC4-6. mRNA for each family was detected in Arabidopsis roots, leaves, stems, and flowers indicating that members of each family are expressed in most if not all tissues.
Genome-wide association study of heading and flowering dates and construction of its prediction equation in Chinese common wheat. Heading date is one of the most important traits in wheat breeding as it affects adaptation and yield potential. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the 90\xa0K iSelect SNP genotyping assay indicated that a total of 306 loci were significantly associated with heading and flowering dates in 13 environments in Chinese common wheat from the Yellow and Huai wheat region. Of these, 105 loci were significantly correlated with both heading and flowering dates and were found in clusters on chromosomes 2, 5, 6, and 7. Based on differences in distribution of the vernalization and photoperiod genes among chromosomes, arms, or block regions, 13 novel, environmentally stable genetic loci were associated with heading and flowering dates, including RAC875_c41145_189 on 1DS, RAC875_c50422_299 on 2BL, and RAC875_c48703_148 on 2DS, that accounted for more than 20% phenotypic variance explained (PVE) of the heading/flowering date in at least four environments. GWAS and t test of a combination of SNPs and vernalization and photoperiod alleles indicated that the Vrn-B1, Vrn-D1, and Ppd-D1 genes significantly affect heading and flowering dates in Chinese common wheat. Based on the association of heading and flowering dates with the vernalization and photoperiod alleles at seven loci and three significant SNPs, optimal linear regression equations were established, which show that of the seven loci, the Ppd-D1 gene plays the most important role in modulating heading and flowering dates in Chinese wheat, followed by Vrn-B1 and Vrn-D1. Additionally, three novel genetic loci (RAC875_c41145_189, Excalibur_c60164_137, and RAC875_c50422_299) also show important effect on heading and flowering dates. Therefore, Ppd-D1, Vrn-B1, Vrn-D1, and the novel genetic loci should be further investigated in terms of improving heading and flowering dates in Chinese wheat. Further quantitative analysis of an F 10 recombinant inbred lines population identified a major QTL that controls heading and flowering dates within the Ppd-D1 locus with PVEs of 28.4% and 34.0%, respectively; this QTL was also significantly associated with spike length, peduncle length, fertile spikelets number, cold resistance, and tiller number.
Antioxidant capacity of several Iranian, wild and cultivated strains of the button mushroom. The white button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus, is the most commonly grown mushroom in Iran; however, there is a significant shortage of research on its antioxidant activity and other medicinal properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate antioxidant capacity of the methanolic extracts from four cultivated strains and four Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS)-identified, Iranian wild isolates of A. bisporus. Evaluations were made for total phenols, flavonoids and anthocyanins, and 2, 2-diphenyl- 1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity. Overall, results showed that all the wild isolates exhibited significantly lower DPPH-derived EC50, compared to the cultivated strains (p < 0.05). A relatively high relationship was observed between total phenols and flavonoids or anthocyanins (r2 > 0.60). However, these constituents could not statistically differentiate the group of wild samples from the cultivated ones, and there was low correlation with the DPPH-derived EC50s (r2 < 0.40). In conclusion, comparisons showed that wild isolate 4 and cultivated strains A15 and H1 had higher antioxidant capacity than the others (p < 0.05). This result identifies these mushrooms as good candidates for further investigation.
Variability in indian mustard (Brassica juncea) genotypes in response to applied phosphorus. A field study was conducted during the winter season (rabi) 2012–13 at Ludhiana, Punjab, to identify the phos-phorus-efficient genotypes of Indian mustard [Brassica juncea (L.) Czernj. & Cosson]. Application of 15 kg/ha of P2O5 increased the seed yield by 6.8% and stover yield by 8.5% over the control, whereas the increase with 30 kg/ ha of P2O5 over 15 kg/ha of P2O5 was non-significant. The increase in oil content and P uptake at maturity with successive dose of phosphorus was also significant. Among genotypes, ‘NRCHB 101’ with the highest seed (1.91 t/ ha) and stover (7.29 t/ha) yields outyielded all the other tested genotypes by significant margin of 6.7–30.8% for seed yield and 9.0–30.9% for stover yield. Genotype ‘NRCDR 2’ registered significantly higher oil content (40.2%), while ‘NRCHB 101’ registered significantly higher total phosphorus uptake at maturity (21.52 kg/ha). Interactions between doses of phosphorus and genotypes for all the parameters were found non-significant.
Evolution of codon usage and base contents in kinetoplastid protozoans. In this study we analyze and compare the trends in codon usage in five representative species of kinetoplastid protozoans (Crithidia fasciculata, Leishmania donovani, L. major, Trypanosoma cruzi and T. brucei), with the purpose of investigating the processes underlying these trends. A principal component analysis shows that the G + C content at the third codon position represents the main source of codon-usage variation, both within species (among genes) and among species. The non-Trypanosoma species exhibit narrow distributions in codon usage, while both Trypanosoma species present large within-species heterogeneity. The three non-Trypanosoma species have very similar codon-usage preferences. These codon preferences are also shared by the highly expressed genes of T. cruzi and to a lesser degree by those of T. brucei. This leads to the conclusion that the codon preferences shared by these species are the ancestral ones in the kinetoplastids. On the other hand, the study of noncoding sequences shows that Trypanosoma species exhibit mutational biases toward A + T richness, while the non-Trypanosoma species present mutational pressure in the opposite direction. These data taken together allow us to infer the origin of the different codon-usage distributions observed in the five species studied. In C. fasciculata and Leishmania, both mutational biases and (translational) selection pull toward G + C richness, resulting in a narrow distribution. In Trypanosoma species the mutational pressure toward A + T richness produced a shift in their genomes that differentially affected coding and noncoding sequences. The effect of these pressures on the third codon position of genes seems to have been inversely proportional to the level of gene expression.
RNA Interference Analysis of the Functions of Cyclin B in Male Reproductive Development of the Oriental River Prawn (Macrobrachium nipponense). Cyclin B (CycB) plays essential roles in cell proliferation and promotes gonad development in many crustaceans. The goal of this study was to investigate the regulatory roles of this gene in the reproductive development of male oriental river prawns (Macrobrachium nipponense). A phylo-genetic tree analysis revealed that the protein sequence of Mn-CycB was most closely related to those of freshwater prawns, whereas the evolutionary distance from crabs was much longer. A quantitative PCR analysis showed that the expression of Mn-CycB was highest in the gonad of both male and female prawns compared to that in other tissues (p < 0.05), indicating that this gene may play essential roles in the regulation of both testis and ovary development in M. nipponense. In males, Mn-CycB expression in the testis and androgenic gland was higher during the reproductive season than during the non-reproductive season (p < 0.05), implying that CycB plays essential roles in the reproductive development of male M. nipponense. An RNA interference analysis revealed that the Mn-insulin-like androgenic gland hormone expression decreased as the Mn-CycB expression decreased, and that few sperm were detected 14 days after the dsCycB treatment, indicating that CycB positively affects testis development in M. nipponense. The results of this study highlight the functions of CycB in M. nipponense, and they can be applied to studies of male reproductive development in other crustacean species.
'Effects of modified processing methods on structural changes of black soybean protein isolate. To explore better methods of natural protein modification for black soybean, comparisons among the effects of different modified methods on structural changes of the modified products of black soybean protein isolate (BSPI) were carried out in this study. The modified products used in this study included enzymatic crossing-link black soybean protein isolate (ECBSPI), wet heating treatment glycosylation black soybean protein isolate (WHTGBSPI) and especially enzymatic glycosylation black soybean protein isolate catalyzed by transglutaminase (EGBSPI). The effects of the modification methods on structural changes were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), amino acid content and circular dichroism (CD) analysis. Moreover, the processing properties changes caused by structural changes of BSPI were detected by thermogravimetric analysis, particle size analysis, zeta-potential, surface hydrophobicity, solubility, emulsification, gelation, and rheological properties. The results show that the modified BSPI products were protein polymers, and among them, EGBSP and WHTGBSPI are covalently bonded glycation products. Products modified by Maillard reactions and transglutaminase (TG) display partly destroyed α-helix and β-sheet structures that form more open secondary BSPI structures. For ECBSPI, the proportion of irregular crimp structure reduces to form a high order secondary structure. All the modified products form fine aggregations in dispersion, except WHTGBSPI has most negative zeta-potential and least molecular stability due to the hydrophobic amino acids embedded in the protein molecules. The zeta-potentials of BSPI, ECBSPI, WHTGBSPI and EGBSPI are respectively −21.5, −23.8, −18.1 and −20.2 mV. The surface hydrophobicity of EGBSPI (5.07 ± 0.07) and WHTGBSPI (7.02 ± 0.05) decrease, while the surface hydrophobicity of ECBSPI (19.5 ± 0.06) increases. The solubility and rheological properties of EGBSPI, ECBSPI and WHTGBSPI after modification are all better than those of BSPI, especially EGBSPI. Emulsification of EGBSPI and WHTGBSPI increase (by 24.5% and 12.2%, respectively) while ECBSPI decrease (by 17.0), and there is similar emulsion stability trend. Moreover, the properties of ECBSPI increase except cohesiveness compared to BSPI. In conclusion, as a safe and efficient method for natural protein modification, enzymatic glycosylation catalyzed by TG has great potential in improving food processing characteristics.
Impact of granule hydration on maize and wheat starch chemical reactivity at the granular and molecular levels. Granular and molecular reaction patterns of maize and wheat starches (normal and waxy genotypes) were investigated in relation to extent of granule hydration (equilibrated at 25, 55, 75, 86 or 100% relative humidity [RH]; moisture range ≈ 10–40 g/100 g starch) within a model reaction system utilizing a fluorescent reagent (5-(4,6-dichlorotriazinyl)aminofluorescein). The greatest incremental increase in granule hydration (49–80%) and overall extent of reaction (30-76-fold) occurred between 86 and 100% RH, likely accentuating the starch glass transition temperature (Tg), which was depressed to room temperature via gradual granule hydration. Under limited hydration conditions (25–86% RH; presumably below Tg), reaction was confined to granule surfaces, whereas under conditions of sufficient hydration/plasticization (100% RH; presumably above Tg), reaction occurred throughout the granule matrix, dramatically increasing reaction of amylose and amylopectin branch chains. For normal starches, amylose was more inert to reaction in low moisture conditions (25–87% RH), indicating either a lesser prevalence at granular surfaces or insufficient hydration to react. Waxy starches exhibited more homogenous granular reaction patterns and greater overall extents of reaction than their respective normal starch counterparts, due to reactivity differences amongst amylose and amylopectin medium and long chains. Findings also provide insights for manipulating granular/molecular reaction locale in “dry” starch modifications.
Induction of proliferative responses of T cells from Babesia bovis-immune cattle with a recombinant 77-kilodalton merozoite protein (Bb-1). A major portion of a Babesia bovis-specific gene encoding a 77-kDa merozoite protein (Bb-1) produced during natural infection in cattle and in microaerophilous culture was subcloned into the pGEX1N expression vector. Recombinant Bb-1 protein fused to glutathione S-transferase (Bb-1-GST) was used to examine cellular immune responses in B. bovis-immune cattle. Sera from rabbits immunized with Bb-1-GST reacted with fusion protein and with the native antigen present in crude B. bovis but not with B. bigemina merozoites. Bb-1-GST but not GST induced strong proliferation of T lymphocytes from these immune cattle, and Bb-1-reactive T-cell lines which consisted of a mixed population of either CD4+ and CD8+ cells or CD4+, CD8+, and 'null' (γδ T) cells were established by in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with the recombinant fusion protein. Three CD4+ CD8- and three CD4- CD8+ Bb-1-specific T-cell clones were identified after limiting- dilution cloning of the cell lines. The studies described here demonstrate that the 77-kDa protein of B. bovis contains T-cell epitopes capable of eliciting proliferation of two types of T cells in immune cattle, an important consideration for the design of a recombinant subunit vaccine.
Rapid assessment of sacred groves: A biodiversity assessment tool for ground level practitioners. Sacred groves in the Western Ghats are culturally preserved patches of forests that are rich in diversity owing to protection by several generations of local people, providing excellent examples of community based conservation. Sacred groves harbour local populations, preserve genetic resources and serve as reference sites and corridors between protected areas. They are considered to be cornerstones of biodiversity conservation, but are insufficient in scale and number to significantly address many aspects of the management of landscapes and biodiversity. We studied 13 sacred groves in Pune District that are at present outside the protected areas of the northern Western Ghats, where we employed a simple and rapid biodiversity assessment technique that can be replicated by frontline foresters, local residents and Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs). Integrating these sacred sites into the conservation network through local support can improve the efficiency for the existing protected area network in this ecologically fragile region.
Microbial community structure in sand on two olive ridley arribada nesting beaches, Playa La Flor, Nicaragua and Playa Nancite, Costa Rica. Microbial relative abundance, diversity and richness were assessed based on 16S rRNA gene-based TRF community analysis via terminal restriction fragment (TRF) analysis on two olive ridley turtle arribada nesting beaches in Central America, Playa La Flor in Nicaragua and Playa Nancite in Costa Rica. Arribada beaches have very high densities of egg clutches in small areas, and the sand contains numerous broken eggs due to turtles inadvertently disturbing previously laid clutches. The high organic content (broken eggs) in the sand causes microbial build up in clutches, which in return may affect hatching success. Phylotype relative abundance (fragment abundance) differed with nest density and distance from the water at both Playa Nancite and Playa La Flor. Higher relative abundance of certain bacterial species in high nest density areas may have contributed to lower hatching success. Bacterial diversity and richness increased with nest density and were higher in the zones closer to vegetation suggesting that bacterial diversity and richness may be important factors affecting hatching success of olive ridley eggs on these nesting beaches. To better conserve olive ridley sea turtles and manage egg harvest on arribada nesting beaches further studies should focus on identifying bacterial species that are pathogenic to turtle eggs and their effects on hatching success.
Modeling framework for optimal evacuation of large-scale crowded pedestrian facilities. The paper presents a simulation-optimization modeling framework for the evacuation of large-scale pedestrian facilities with multiple exit gates. The framework integrates a genetic algorithm (GA) and a microscopic pedestrian simulation-Assignment model. The GA searches for the optimal evacuation plan, while the simulation model guides the search through evaluating the quality of the generated evacuation plans. Evacuees are assumed to receive evacuation instructions in terms of the optimal exit gates and evacuation start times. The framework is applied to develop an optimal evacuation plan for a hypothetical crowded exhibition hall. The obtained results show that the model converges to a superior optimal evacuation plan within an acceptable number of iterations. In addition, the obtained evacuation plan outperforms conventional plans that implement nearest-gate immediate evacuation strategies.
An efficient controlled elitism non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm for multi-objective supplier selection under fuzziness. Supplier selection and order allocation constitute vital strategic decisions that must be made by managers within supply chain management environments. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective fuzzy model for supplier selection and order allocation in a two-level supply chain with multi-period, multi-source, and multi-product characteristics. The supplier evaluation objectives considered in this model include cost, delay, and electronic-waste (e-waste) minimization, as well as coverage and weight maximization. A signal function is used to model the price discount offered by the suppliers. Triangular fuzzy numbers are used to deal with the uncertainty of delay and e-waste parameters while the fuzzy Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is used to obtain the weights of the suppliers. The resulting NP-hard problem, a Pareto-based meta-heuristic algorithm called controlled elitism non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (CENSGA), is developed. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) are used to validate the applicability of the CENSGA algorithm and the Taguchi technique to tune the parameters of the algorithms. The results are analysed using graphical and statistical comparisons illustrating how the proposed CENSGA dominates NSGA-II and MOPSO in terms of mean ideal solution distance (MID) and spacing metrics.
Comparing performance of multiple non-invasive genetic capture-recapture methods for abundance estimation: A case study with the Sonoran pronghorn Antilocapra americana sonoriensis. Demographic monitoring is required in threatened species management, yet effective and efficient monitoring is challenging for species that are difficult to capture or susceptible to capture stress. One possible monitoring approach for such species is non-invasive genetic sampling with capture-recapture methods (genetic capture-recapture). We evaluated the performance of genetic capture-recapture in a challenging model system, monitoring the threatened Sonoran pronghorn Antilocapra americana sonoriensis. In an effort to determine the best (i.e. efficient, accurate, precise, cost-effective) method for abundance estimation, we used simulations to examine the optimal genetic capture-recapture faecal sampling design for this population. We simulated encounter histories for 100-300 individuals, with 0.33-3.33 samples/individual/session, in 1-3 sampling sessions. We explored trade-offs between sample size, number of sessions and multi-session (MARK) versus single-session (capwire) closed capture-recapture abundance estimators, and an accurate and precise estimate. We also compared the cost between the genetic capture-recapture approaches and current aerial monitoring methods. Abundance was biased positively in capwire and negatively in MARK. Bias increased and precision decreased with fewer samples/individual/session. Annual genetic capture-recapture monitoring cost was nearly twice the cost of aerial surveys, although genetic capture-recapture methods provided much higher precision. However at the current estimated abundance (c. 200), the same level of precision achieved with aerial methods can be obtained by collecting 0.75 samples/individual in a single session, for an annual cost saving of > USD 4,000. This approach of comparing estimator performance and cost can easily be applied to other systems and is a useful evaluation for managers to implement prior to designing capture-recapture studies.
Genome-wide association study between single nucleotide polymorphisms and flight speed in Nellore cattle. Introduction Cattle temperament is an important factor that affects the profitability of beef cattle enterprises, due to its relationship with productivity traits, animal welfare and labor safety. Temperament is a complex phenotype often assessed by measuring a series of behavioral traits, which result from the effects of multiple environmental and genetic factors, and their interactions. The aims of this study were to perform a genome-wide association study and detect genomic regions, potential candidate genes and their biological mechanisms underlying temperament, measured by flight speed (FS) test in Nellore cattle. Materials and Methods The genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using a single-step procedure (ssGBLUP) which combined simultaneously all 16,600 phenotypes from genotyped and non-genotyped animals, full pedigree information of 162,645 animals and 1,384 genotyped animals in one step. The animals were genotyped with High Density Bovine SNP BeadChip which contains 777,962 SNP markers. After quality control (QC) a total of 455,374 SNPs remained. Results Heritability estimated for FS was 0.21 ± 0.02. Consecutive SNPs explaining 1% or more of the total additive genetic variance were considered as windows associated with FS. Nine candidate regions located on eight different Bos taurus chromosomes (BTA) (1 at 73 Mb, 2 at 65 Mb, 5 at 22 Mb and 119 Mb, 9 at 98 Mb, 11 at 67 Mb, 15 at 16 Mb, 17 at 63 Kb, and 26 at 47 Mb) were identified. The candidate genes identified in these regions were NCKAP5 (BTA2), PARK2 (BTA9), ANTXR1 (BTA11), GUCY1A2 (BTA15), CPE (BTA17) and DOCK1 (BTA26). Among these genes PARK2, GUCY1A2, CPE and DOCK1 are related to dopaminergic system, memory formation, biosynthesis of peptide hormone and neurotransmitter and brain development, respectively. Conclusions Our findings allowed us to identify nine genomic regions (SNP windows) associated with beef cattle temperament, measured by FS test. Within these windows, six promising candidate genes and their biological functions were identified. These results may contribute to a better comprehension into the genetic control of temperament expression in Nellore cattle.
Genetic diversity and aggressiveness of Ophiosphaerella korrae, a cause of spring dead spot of bermudagrass. The distribution of three Ophiosphaerella spp. that cause spring dead spot (SDS) of bermudagrass was studied by sampling at 24 locations in the southeastern United States. O. korrae was isolated from 73% of the 204 bermudagrass cores collected and was the only SDS pathogen recovered at most sites. O. herpotricha was isolated at three locations in Kentucky and one in North Carolina, and O. narmari was found at two locations in North Carolina. Most O. korrae isolates collected from Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia clustered in an amplified fragment length polymorphism group (AFLP group II) that was distinct from Kentucky bluegrass isolates collected throughout North America and similar to bermudagrass isolates from Kansas and Oklahoma (AFLP group I). A third AFLP group (III) consisting of bermudagrass isolates from Mississippi and Virginia was identified. Isolates representing AFLP groups II and III grew more rapidly on potato dextrose agar at 25 and 30°C than those in group I. O. korrae isolates differed in their aggressiveness to two bermudagrass cultivars in greenhouse studies, but these differences were not associated with AFLP group, location, or host from which the isolate was collected.
Inter-genotype aggression in the solitary sea anemone Actinia tenebrosa. Acrorhagial fighting occurs between some pairs of adult Actinia tenebrosa, and such fighting almost always results in the locomotory withdrawal of the loser. Adults are also able to attack and kill juvenile conspecifics in laboratory conditions. In laboratory trials, 58 of 89 pairs of adults responded aggressively when placed in contact. Conflicts developed disproportionately often when adults were genotypically different, as judged by electrophoretic examination of 5 polymorphic enzymes, or when adults were markedly different in weight. Neither the sexual maturity nor presence of brooded juveniles affected the probability that conflicts would develop between adults. Weight did not affect the outcome of the conflicts. Presentation of apparently asexually produced juveniles to adults revealed that both the recognition and effector phases of the acrorhagial response are triggered by genotypic dissimilarity and not by size dissimilarity per se. Acrorhagial responses were initiated only on contact with juveniles from other adults. Localised release of asexually-produced brooded juveniles contributes substantially to recruitment within established populations of A. tenebrosa. Aggressive interactions between genotypes thus seem likely to play an important role in intra-specific competition for recruitment space.
Segregation of scab resistance in three apple populations: Molecular marker and phenotypic analyses. The codominant PCR marker AL07-SCAR closely linked to the Vf gene for scab resistance was used to genotype seedlings in three apple populations in which each parent ('GoldRush', 'Enterprise', 'Pristine', and CQR10T17) was resistant to apple scab. The marker was used to predict the genotype at the Vf locus. Each parent was heterozygous. In two populations (CQR10T17 x 'GoldRush' and 'Pristine' x 'GoldRush') seedlings segregated 1:2:1 for fragments associated with VfVf:V fvf:vfvf as predicted by Mendelian segregation. However, in another population ('GoldRush' x 'Enterprise') the ratio was 1.5:1:1.5, suggesting some type of selection against heterozygotes. Fruiting seedlings were rated for the presence of fruit scab. No scab was observed on seedlings homozygous for the PCR marker linked to Vf, a small amount of scab was observed on one heterozygous seedling out of 35, and 22 of 26 seedlings that were homozygous recessive, had fruit scab.
tRNAS undermethylation in a met-regulatory mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A study of in vivo and in vitro methylation of tRNAs in regulatory mutants affected in methionine-mediated repression (eth2, eth3, eth10) has led to the following results:o1)The eth2-2 carrying strain presents a great undermethylation of its tRNAs, of the same order of magnitude as observed during methionine starvation of methionine auxotrophs.2)This undermethylation leads to a shift of the tRNAmetIII peak on a BD cellulose column, while tRNAmetkIII peak is unchanged.3)The study of a double mutant strain carrying eth2 and met2 mutations has shown that this undermethylation is a consequence of the high internal pool of methionine.4)Undermethylation unequally affects the different bases and the different tRNA species.
Studies on the distribution of complementary genes causing F1 weakness in common rice and its wild relatives. 2. Distribution of two complementary genes, Hwc-1 and Hwc-2 gene in native cultivars and its wild relatives of tropical Asia. Distribution of two complementary genes Hwc-1 and Hwc-2 causing F1 weakness was examined using 159 native rice cultivars and 30 strains of wild relatives collected from various sites of tropical Asia including the Himalayan foothills. Hwc-1 is carried by a Peruvian cultivar, Jamaica, a tester cultivar of this experiment. It was not found in the tested cultivars and strains. Hwc-2 was widely distributed in the Japonica types tested. No wild strains had either Hwc-1 or Hwc-2. Hwc-2 was infrequent in the Japonica types collected from Southern Asian countries. Hwc-2 was estimated to be indigenous to the Japonica types, may be linked with certain gene(s) related to adaptation.
Identification, characterization, and utilization of genome-wide simple sequence repeats to identify a QTL for acidity in apple. Background: Apple is an economically important fruit crop worldwide. Developing a genetic linkage map is a critical step towards mapping and cloning of genes responsible for important horticultural traits in apple. To facilitate linkage map construction, we surveyed and characterized the distribution and frequency of perfect microsatellites in assembled contig sequences of the apple genome.Results: A total of 28,538 SSRs have been identified in the apple genome, with an overall density of 40.8 SSRs per Mb. Di-nucleotide repeats are the most frequent microsatellites in the apple genome, accounting for 71.9% of all microsatellites. AT/TA repeats are the most frequent in genomic regions, accounting for 38.3% of all the G-SSRs, while AG/GA dimers prevail in transcribed sequences, and account for 59.4% of all EST-SSRs. A total set of 310 SSRs is selected to amplify eight apple genotypes. Of these, 245 (79.0%) are found to be polymorphic among cultivars and wild species tested. AG/GA motifs in genomic regions have detected more alleles and higher PIC values than AT/TA or AC/CA motifs. Moreover, AG/GA repeats are more variable than any other dimers in apple, and should be preferentially selected for studies, such as genetic diversity and linkage map construction. A total of 54 newly developed apple SSRs have been genetically mapped. Interestingly, clustering of markers with distorted segregation is observed on linkage groups 1, 2, 10, 15, and 16. A QTL responsible for malic acid content of apple fruits is detected on linkage group 8, and accounts for ~13.5% of the observed phenotypic variation.Conclusions: This study demonstrates that di-nucleotide repeats are prevalent in the apple genome and that AT/TA and AG/GA repeats are the most frequent in genomic and transcribed sequences of apple, respectively. All SSR motifs identified in this study as well as those newly mapped SSRs will serve as valuable resources for pursuing apple genetic studies, aiding the apple breeding community in marker-assisted breeding, and for performing comparative genomic studies in Rosaceae.
Doublesex- and Mab-3-related transcription factor-1 repression of aromatase transcription, a possible mechanism favoring the male pathway in Tilapia. Doublesex- and Mab-3-related transcription factor-1 (Dmrt1) is an important transcription factor implicated in early testicular differentiation in vertebrates, but its target genes are largely unknown. In the Nile tilapia, estrogen is the natural inducer of ovarian differentiation. Our recent studies haveshownthat Forkhead-l2 up-regulated transcription of the Cyp19a1a gene (aromatase) in the gonads in a female-specific manner. However, the upstream factor(s) down-regulating Cyp19a1a expression during testicular differentiation remains unclear. In the present study, we used in vitro (promoter analysis) and in vivo (transgenesis and in situ hybridization) approaches to examine whether Dmrt1 inhibits Cyp19a1a's transcriptional activity. The in vitro analysis using luciferase assays revealed that Dmrt1 repressed basal as well as Ad4BP/SF-1-activated Cyp19a1a transcription in HEK 293 cells. Luciferase assays with various deletions of Dmrt1 also showed that the Doublesex and Mab-3 domain is essential for the repression. In vitro-translated Dmrt1 and the nuclear extract from tilapia testis could directly bind to the palindrome sequence ACATATGT in the Cyp19a1a promoter, as determined by EMSAs. Transgenic overexpression of Dmrt1 in XX fish resulted in decreased aromatase gene expression, reduced serum estradiol-17β levels, retardation of the ovarian cavity's development, varying degrees of follicular degeneration, and even a partial to complete sex reversal. Our results indicate that aromatase is one of the targets of Dmrt1. Dmrt1 suppresses the female pathway by repressing aromatase gene transcription and estrogen production in the gonads of tilapia and possibly other vertebrates.
Inkjet Printed Nanopatterned Aptamer-Based Sensors for Improved Optical Detection of Foodborne Pathogens. The increasing incidence of infectious outbreaks from contaminated food and water supply continues imposing a global burden for food safety, creating a market demand for on-site, disposable, easy-to-use, and cost-efficient devices. Despite of the rapid growth of biosensors field and the generation of breakthrough technologies, more than 80% of the platforms developed at lab-scale never will get to meet the market. This work aims to provide a cost-efficient, reliable, and repeatable approach for the detection of foodborne pathogens in real samples. For the first time an optimized inkjet printing platform is proposed taking advantage of a carefully controlled nanopatterning of novel carboxyl-functionalized aptameric ink on a nitrocellulose substrate for the highly efficient detection of E. coli O157:H7 (25 colony forming units (CFU) mL−1 in pure culture and 233 CFU mL−1 in ground beef) demonstrating the ability to control the variation within ±1 SD for at least 75% of the data collected even at very low concentrations. From the best of the knowledge this work reports the lowest limit of detection of the state of the art for paper-based optical detection of E. coli O157:H7, with enough evidence (p > 0.05) to prove its high specificity at genus, species, strain, and serotype level.
Identification of downstream effectors of retinoic acid specifying the zebrafish pancreas by integrative genomics. Retinoic acid (RA) is a key signal for the specification of the pancreas. Still, the gene regulatory cascade triggered by RA in the endoderm remains poorly characterized. In this study, we investigated this regulatory network in zebrafish by combining RNA-seq, RAR ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq assays. By analysing the effect of RA and of the RA receptor (RAR) inverse-agonist BMS493 on the transcriptome and on the chromatin accessibility of endodermal cells, we identified a large set of genes and regulatory regions regulated by RA signalling. RAR ChIP-seq further defined the direct RAR target genes in zebrafish, including hox genes as well as several pancreatic regulators like mnx1, insm1b, hnf1ba and gata6. Comparison of zebrafish and murine RAR ChIP-seq data highlighted the conserved direct target genes and revealed that some RAR sites are under strong evolutionary constraints. Among them, a novel highly conserved RAR-induced enhancer was identified downstream of the HoxB locus and driving expression in the nervous system and in the gut in a RA-dependent manner. Finally, ATAC-seq data unveiled the role of the RAR-direct targets Hnf1ba and Gata6 in opening chromatin at many regulatory loci upon RA treatment.
Genomic signatures of experimental adaptive radiation in Drosophila. Abiotic environmental factors play a fundamental role in determining the distribution, abundance and adaptive diversification of species. Empowered by new technologies enabling rapid and increasingly accurate examination of genomic variation in populations, researchers may gain new insights into the genomic background of adaptive radiation and stress resistance. We investigated genomic variation across generations of large-scale experimental selection regimes originating from a single founder population of Drosophila melanogaster, diverging in response to ecologically relevant environmental stressors: heat shock, heat knock down, cold shock, desiccation and starvation. When compared to the founder population, and to parallel unselected controls, there were more than 100,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) displaying consistent allelic changes in response to selective pressures across generations. These SNPs were found in both coding and noncoding sequences, with the highest density in promoter regions, and involved a broad range of functionalities, including molecular chaperoning by heat-shock proteins. The SNP patterns were highly stressor-specific despite considerable variation among line replicates within each selection regime, as reflected by a principal component analysis, and co-occurred with selective sweep regions. Only ~15% of SNPs with putatively adaptive changes were shared by at least two selective regimes, while less than 1% of SNPs diverged in opposite directions. Divergent stressors driving evolution in the experimental system of adaptive radiation left distinct genomic signatures, most pronounced in starvation and heat-shock selection regimes.
A highly efficient transformation protocol for Micro-Tom, a model cultivar for tomato functional genomics. We report a highly efficient protocol for the Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation of a miniature dwarf tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), Micro-Tom, a model cultivar for tomato functional genomics. Cotyledon explants of tomato inoculated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens (Rhizobium radiobacter) C58C1RifR harboring the binary vector pIG121Hm generated a mass of chimeric non-transgenic and transgenic adventitious buds. Repeated shoot elongation from the mass of adventitious buds on selection media resulted in the production of multiple transgenic plants that originated from independent transformation events. The transformation efficiency exceeded 40% of the explants. This protocol could become a powerful tool for functional genomics in tomato.
Trithemis morrisoni sp. nov. and T. palustris sp. nov. from the Okavango and Upper Zambezi Floodplains previously hidden under T. stictica (Odonata: Libellulidae). During the course of a population genetic study of Trithemis stictica that included sites in Namibia, Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Botswana and Zambia, two undescribed libellulid species were discovered in the Okavango and Upper Zambezi Floodplains. These were both previously identified as T. stictica. We describe the two species, T. morrisoni sp. nov. (holotype ♂: Namibia, Nature Reserve Popa Falls, Okavango River at the rapids, 18°07′S, 21°40′; iv 2007, leg. K.-D.B. Dijkstra; dep. in the National Museum of Namibia, Windhoek) and T. palustris sp. nov. (holotype ♂: Botswana, Okavango Delta, Moremi Game Reserve, 19°15′S, 23°20′E; ii 2007, leg J. Kipping; dep. in the National Museum of Namibia, Windhoek) and compare them with T. stictica.
Peculiarities of oogenesis in the chick. I. Extrafollicular period in the development of oocytes. The early stages of oogenesis in the chick were studied by means of light cytochemistry and autoradiography. The oocytes devoid of follicular epithelium are located in the ovarian cortex in groups of 8, 16 or 32 cells. Within the bounds of the group they develop synchronously until the beginning of formation of the follicular epithelium around each oocyte. By 15 days of postembryonic development all oocytes in the ovarian cortex enter the diplotene stage of meiotic prophase. The formation of follicles is completed by 22 days. The morphological descriptions are given for the oocyte nuclei at the preleptotene, leptotene, zygotene, pachytene and early diplotene stages of meiotic prophase. The nucleolus appears at the early diplotene stage and is characterized by extremely weak synthetic activity. It is specially stressed that the nucleolus does not form in alloocytes and that the population of germ cells in the chick ovary is heterogenous by this character. The beginning of RNA synthesis in the oocyte nucleus is timed to the early diplotene stage. The data are obtained on DNA synthesis in the nuclei of preleptotene and leptotene oocytes not related to the amplification of ribosomal genes.
Extended MLST-based population genetics and phylogeny of Vibrio parahaemolyticus with high levels of recombination. A collection of 174 global isolates of Vibrio parahaemolyticus were analyzed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) on the basis of ten conserved genes. The results showed a high level of nucleotide and allelic diversity with the evidence of purifying selection and of frequent recombination. Recombination played a much greater role than mutation in generating genetic heterogeneity. The 174 strains could be assigned into 89 different sequence types, which could be further separated into six clonal complexes (CCs; CC1 to CC6) plus 71 singletons. The three major CCs, namely CC1 to CC3, corresponded to the groups of pre-1996 clinical old-O3:K6 strains (trh+, T3SS2β+, Tdh-, T3SS2β-, and GS-PCR-), post-1996 pandemic strains (trh-, T3SS2β-, tdh+, T3SS2β+, and GS-PCR+) and non-clinical isolates (trh-, T3SS2β-, tdh-, T3SS2β-, and GS-PCR-), respectively. The MLST data enable the construction of a phylogenetic structure from the allelic profiles rather the nucleotide sequences, so as to reduce the affect of frequent recombination. The six CCs arose on a background of mutation and recombination, and according to the previously reported data, this bacterium could be evolved fast due to lateral acquisition of foreign genes especially including those encoding virulence determinants. V. parahaemolyticus had a typical epidemic population structure that is driven by mutation, recombination and lateral gene transfer.
'Bio-inspired optimization of interval type-2 fuzzy controllers. A review of the optimization methods used in the design of type-2 fuzzy systems, which are relatively novel models of imprecision, has been considered in this paper. The fundamental focus of the work has been based on the basic reasons of the need for optimizing type-2 fuzzy systems for different areas of application. Recently, bio-inspired methods have emerged as powerful optimization algorithms for solving complex problems. In the case of designing type-2 fuzzy systems for particular applications, the use of bio-inspired optimization methods have helped in the complex task of finding the appropriate parameter values and structure of the fuzzy systems. In this paper, we consider the application of genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization as three different paradigms that help in the design of optimal type-2 fuzzy systems. We also provide a comparison of the different optimization methods for the case of designing type-2 fuzzy systems.
Growth of uncultured heterotrophic flagellates in unamended seawater incubations. Unamended dark incubations of 3 μm-filtered seawater were prepared with surface samples from the Norwegian Sea, the NW Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. Except for the very oligotrophic Indian Ocean samples, this simple treatment promoted the growth of heterotrophic flagellates, with rates (0.3 to 1.2 d-1) typical of natural assemblages. Marine stramenopile (MAST)-1 and MAST-4 cell counts, obtained by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), increased in most incubations. These yet uncultured protists were first detected in molecular surveys of marine picoplankton and have been recently shown to be globally distributed heterotrophic flagellates. Three incubations from the Norwegian Sea were studied in more detail by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), 18S rRNA gene clone libraries and FISH counts for 5 MAST groups. Protist diversity changed gradually during the incubation, but the DGGE bands selected were already present at the beginning of the incubation. Clone libraries from the peaks in abundance of heterotrophic flagellates were dominated by MAST seguences. FISH counts revealed MAST-1B to be a very successful organism in the 3 incubations, accounting for 15 to 30% of heterotrophic flagellates after 6 to 8 d; MAST-1A and -1C cells were also abundant. MAST-4 cells peaked before the other groups and MAST-2 was the least represented. We concluded that unamended seawater incubations can select for heterotrophic flagellates abundant in situ but not yet isolated in pure culture. Therefore, they allow investigation of the growth requirements and dynamics of these uncultured protists, and provide promising preliminary stages for their isolation.
Nop53p is required for late 60S ribosome subunit maturation and nuclear export in yeast. We report that Ypl146cp/Nop53p is associated with pre-60S ribosomal complexes and localized to the nucleolus and nucleoplasm. In cells depleted of Nop53p synthesis of the rRNA components of the 60S ribosomal subunit is severely inhibited, with strikingly strong accumulation of the 7S pre-rRNA and a 5′ extended form of the 25S rRNA. In cells depleted of Nop53p pre-60S subunits accumulate in the nucleus. However, a heterokaryon assay demonstrated that Nop53p is not transferred between nuclei, indicating that it is not released into the cytoplasm. We conclude that Nop53p is a late-acting factor in the nuclear maturation of 60S ribosomal subunits, which is required for normal acquisition of export competence. The strong accumulation of preribosomes in the Nop53p-depleted strain further suggests that it may participate in targeting aberrant preribosomes to surveillance and degradation pathways.
The Transcriptomic Signature of Tigecycline in Acinetobacter baumannii. Tigecycline, a protein translation inhibitor, is a treatment of last resort for infections caused by the opportunistic multidrug resistance human pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii. However, strains resistant to tigecycline were reported not long after its clinical introduction. Translation inhibitor antibiotics perturb ribosome function and induce the reduction of (p)ppGpp, an alarmone involved in the stringent response that negatively modulates ribosome production. Through RNA sequencing, this study revealed a significant reduction in the transcription of genes in citric acid cycle and cell respiration, suggesting tigecycline inhibits or slows down bacterial growth. Our results indicated that the drug-induced reduction of (p)ppGpp level promoted the production but diminished the degradation of ribosomes, which mitigates the translational inhibition effect by tigecycline. The reduction of (p)ppGpp also led to a decrease of transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair which likely increases the chances of development of tigecycline resistant mutants. Increased expression of genes linked to horizontal gene transfer were also observed. The most upregulated gene, rtcB, involving in RNA repair, is either a direct tigecycline stress response or is in response to the transcription de-repression of a toxin-antitoxin system. The most down-regulated genes encode two β-lactamases, which is a possible by-product of tigecycline-induced reduction in transcription of genes associated with peptidoglycan biogenesis. This transcriptomics study provides a global genetic view of why A. baumannii is able to rapidly develop tigecycline resistance.
So many rhizobial partners, so little nitrogen fixed: The intriguing symbiotic promiscuity of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Symbiotic diazotrophic bacteria collectively called “rhizobia” can associate with legumes and form specialized structures in the roots, called nodules, where the biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) process takes place. Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is a major protein source in the diet of the population of many countries such as Brazil and can benefit from the BNF process, but there is still little knowledge about the diversity and effectiveness of indigenous microsymbionts. In this study, the diversity and the nitrogen fixation ability of bacterial isolates trapped by common bean nodules in 14 municipalities of Mato Grosso do Sul state, Central-Western region, comprising three Brazilian biomes were investigated. The DNA profiles (BOX-PCR) of 82 isolates indicated outstanding diversity, with 12 main clusters and 36 isolates occupying single positions, joined at a final level of similarity of less than 20%. The 16S rRNA phylogeny of 56 isolates representing the DNA profiles indicated ten genera, with 38 isolates identified as “classical rhizobia” and Agrobacterium, and the remaining 18 belonging to six other genera. The 38 isolates had their glnII gene sequenced and were evaluated for the capacity of nodulation and BNF with common bean, and only 12 formed effective nitrogen-fixing nodules, five positioned in the R. etli and six in the R. tropici clades, and one of Agrobacterium. These results highlight the promiscuity of common bean in capturing a variety of microbial species in their nodules, whose function has not been well elucidated yet. Only one-fifth of the isolates were effective in fixing nitrogen, which might explain the frequently reported low rates of contribution of the BNF with this legume, an intriguing paradigm in the evolution of the symbiosis.
Cloning and Rhythmic Expression Analysis of LgFKF1 Gene in Luculia gratissima. [Objective] To study the regulatory role of LgFKF1 gene during flowering process of L.gratissima, based on the analysis of its gene structural characteristics and rhythmic expression in specific tissues. [Method] The RACE technology was used to clone the full length cDNA of LgFKF1 gene. Sequence of nucleotides and code of protein were analyzed by using the software of bioinformatics. qRT-PCR was applied in the rhythmic expression analysis of the gene in specific tissues. [Result] The result of sequence analysis showed that the LgFKF1 cDNA, 2 271 bp in length, has a 1 917 bp open reading frame encoding a putative protein with 638 amino acids. The results of sequence alignment showed that the amino acids sequence was highly homologous with the FKF1 of Kaliphora madagascariensis, Allamanda cathartica, Wrightia natalensis and Asclepias curassavica, with the homology of 92.59%. LgFKF1 protein that had the closest genetic relationship with K. madagascariensis was unstable hydrophilic proteins without signal peptide and transmembrane regions, and located in the nucleus, mainly consisted of alpha helix, irregular curling structure and extended long chain. The result of qRT-PCR showed that the expression of LgFKF1 under inductive photoperiod for 7 days was higher than that under non-inductive photoperiod treatment,but the expression was lower than that under non-inductive photoperiod treatment if inductive photoperiod was more than 10 days. In a day, LgFKF1 expressed in various tissues,and showed a high transcription level in leaf. For the rhythmic expression of LgFKF1 in different tissues, one peak value was appeared at 23:00 in root, leaf bud and flower bud, and two peak values were appeared at 20:00 and 5:00 in stem, 2:00 and 8:00 in leaf, 23:00 and 5:00 in mature flower. [Conclusion] LgFKF1 was cloned from L.gratissima, and its putative protein sequence was highly homologous with the FKF1 of other plants. The expression of LgFKF1 gene was affected by photoperiod.Under the inductive photoperiod, various tissues showed itself expression pattern. A peak value of LgFKF1 expression in leaf was only appeared at 8:00 during the daytime,and the peak values in other tissues were occurred during the night. In these tissues, LgFKF1 showed higher transcription level in leaf. The rhythmic expression of LgFKF1 in specific tissues might be helpful to provides some references for further study on its biological function.
Functional Prediction of trans-Prenyltransferases Reveals the Distribution of GFPPSs in Species beyond the Brassicaceae Clade. Terpenoids are the most diverse class of plant primary and specialized metabolites, and trans-prenyltransferases (trans-PTs) are the first branch point to synthesize precursors of various chain lengths for further metabolism. Whereas the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme is known, there is no reliable method for precisely predicting the functions of trans-PTs. With the exponentially increasing number of available trans-PTs genes in public databases, an in silico functional prediction method for this gene family is urgently needed. Here, we present PTS-Pre, a web tool developed on the basis of the “three floors” model, which shows an overall 86% prediction accuracy for 141 experimentally determined trans-PTs. The method was further validated by in vitro enzyme assays for randomly selected trans-PTs. In addition, using this method, we identified nine new GFPPSs from different plants which are beyond the previously reported Brassicaceae clade, suggesting these genes may have occurred via convergent evolution and are more likely lineage-specific. The high accuracy of our blind prediction validated by enzymatic assays suggests that PTS-Pre provides a convenient and reliable method for genome-wide functional prediction of trans-PTs enzymes and will surely benefit the elucidation and metabolic engineering of terpenoid biosynthetic pathways.
Description of two new species of Hemiphyllodactylus (Reptilia: Gekkonidae) from karst landscapes in Yunnan, China, highlights complex conservation needs. Karst habitats are hotspots of diversity and endemism. Their naturally fragmented distributions across broad geographic landscapes have led to the complex array of smaller evolutionary ecosystems that present unique challenges from a conservation perspective. Comprehensive biodiversity assessments of karst habitats have revealed that these ecosystems contain an almost unparalleled level of endemism, and many site-restricted species remain undescribed, thus posing considerable challenges for effective conservation management. Small rock-dwelling species, such as geckos, may be particularly prone to such isolation. In this paper, we discuss one such genus, i.e., Hemiphyllodactylus, and explore its diversity across karst landforms in Yunnan Province, southwestern China. Based on morphological and genetic data, we describe two new species of Hemiphyllodactylus from karst habitats in Simao District and Yanshan County. A phylogenetic tree for Hemiphyllodactylus was constructed using 1 039 base pairs (bp) of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 gene (ND2). The Simao and Yanshan specimens can be distinguished from all other congeners within their respective subclades based on uncorrected genetic pairwise distances greater than 6.3% and 4.3% respectively, as well as significant morphological differences. The discovery and description of these two new species brings the total number of described Hemiphyllodactylus species in China to 14 and indicates many more undescribed species from unsurveyed karst regions await discovery. Our findings suggest that karst ecosystems in Yunnan support a higher diversity of Hemiphyllodactylus than previously known. This study also highlights the importance of karst ecosystems as refugia for sitespecific endemic species and the need for heightened conservation efforts.
Regulation of non-coding RNAs in heat stress responses of plants. Heat stress is an important factor limiting plant growth, development, and productivity; thus, plants have evolved special adaptive mechanisms to cope with high-temperature stress. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a class of regulatory RNAs that play an important role in many biological processes. Recently developed advanced technologies, such as genome-wide transcriptomic analysis, have revealed that abundant ncRNAs are expressed under heat stress. Although this area of research is still in its infancy, an increasing number of several classes of regulatory ncRNA (i.e., miRNA, siRNA, and lncRNA) related to heat stress responses have been reported. In this mini-review, we discuss our current understanding of the role of ncRNAs in heat stress responses in plants, especially miRNAs, siRNAs, and their targets. For example, the miR398-CSD/CCS-HSF, miR396-WRKY6, miR159-GAMYB, and TAS1-HTT-HSF pathways regulate plant heat tolerance. We highlight the hormone/development-related miRNAs involved in heat stress, and discuss the regulatory networks of miRNA-targets. We also note that DNA methylation and alternative splicing could affect miRNA expression under heat stress, and some lncRNAs could respond to heat stress. Finally, we briefly discuss future prospects concerning the ncRNA-related mechanisms of heat stress responses in plants.
Distinct biochemical and topological properties of the 31- and 27-kilodalton plasma membrane intrinsic protein subgroups from red beet. Plasma membrane vesicles from red beet (Beta vulgaris L.) storage tissue contain two prominent major intrinsic protein species of 31 and 27 kD (X. Qi, C.Y Tai, B.P. Wasserman [1995] Plant Physiol 108: 387-392). In this study affinity-purified antibodies were used to investigate their localization and biochemical properties. Both plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PMIP) subgroups partitioned identically in sucrose gradients; however, each exhibited distinct properties when probed for multimer formation, and by limited proteolysis. The tendency of each PMIP species to form disulfide-linked aggregates was studied by inclusion of various sulfhydryl agents during tissue homogenization and vesicle isolation. In the absence of dithiothreitol and sulfhydryl reagents, PMIP27 yielded a mixture of monomeric and aggregated species. In contrast, generation of a monomeric species of PMIP31 required the addition of dithiothreitol, iodoacetic acid, or N-ethylmaleimide. Mixed disulfide-linked heterodimers between the PMIP31 and PMIP27 subgroups were not detected. Based on vectorial proteolysis of right-side-out vesicles with trypsin and hydropathy analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence derived from the gene encoding PMIP27, a topological model for a PMIP27 was established. Two exposed tryptic cleavage sites were identified from proteolysis of PMIP27, and each was distinct from the single exposed site previously identified in surface loop C of a PMIP31. Although the PMIP31 and PMIP27 species both contain integral proteins that appear to occur within a single vesicle population, these results demonstrate that each PMIP subgroup responds differently to perturbations of the membrane.
