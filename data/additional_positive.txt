No consistent evidence for association between mtDNA variants and Alzheimer disease. Objective: Although several studies have described an association between Alzheimer disease (AD) and genetic variation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), each has implicated different mtDNA variants, so the role of mtDNA in the etiology of AD remains uncertain. Methods: We tested 138 mtDNA variants for association with AD in a powerful sample of 4,133 AD case patients and 1,602 matched controls from 3 Caucasian populations. Of the total population, 3,250 case patients and 1,221 elderly controls met the quality control criteria and were included in the analysis. Results: In the largest study to date, we failed to replicate the published findings. Meta-analysis of the available data showed no evidence of an association with AD. Conclusion: The current evidence linking common mtDNA variations with AD is not compelling.
The clinical implication of SRSF2 mutation in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and its stability during disease evolution. Recurrent somatic mutation of SRSF2, one of the RNA splicing machinery genes, has been identified in a substantial proportion of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). However, the clinical and biologic characteristics of MDS with this mutation remain to be addressed. In this study, 34 (14.6%) of the 233 MDS patients were found to have SRSF2 mutation. SRSF2 mutation was closely associated with male sex (P = .001) and older age (P < .001). It occurred concurrently with at least 1 additional mutation in 29 patients (85.3%) and was closely associated with RUNX1, IDH2, and ASXL1 mutations (P = .004, P < .001, and P < .001, respectively). Patients with SRSF2 mutation had an inferior overall survival (P = .010), especially in the lower risk patients. Further exploration showed that the prognostic impact of SRSF2 mutation might be attributed to its close association with old age. Sequential analyses in 173 samples from 66 patients showed that all SRSF2-mutated patients retained their original mutations, whereas none of the SRSF2-wild patients acquired a novel mutation during disease evolution. In conclusion, SRSF2 mutation is associated with distinct clinical and biologic features in MDS patients. It is stable during the clinical course and may play little role in disease progression.
Low micromolar zinc accelerates the fibrillization of human Tau via bridging of Cys-291 and Cys-322. A hallmark of a group of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease is the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, which are principally composed of bundles of filaments formed by microtubule-associated protein Tau. Clarifying how natively unstructured Tau protein forms abnormal aggregates is of central importance for elucidating the etiology of these diseases. There is considerable evidence showing that zinc, as an essential element that is highly concentrated in brain, is linked to the development or progression of these diseases. Herein, by using recombinant human Tau fragment Tau244-372 and its mutants, we have investigated the effect of zinc on the aggregation of Tau. Low micromolar concentrations of Zn2+ dramatically accelerate fibril formation of wild-type Tau244-372 under reducing conditions, compared with no Zn2+. Higher concentrations of Zn2+, however, induce wild-type Tau244-372 to form granular aggregates in reducing conditions. Moreover, these non-fibrillar aggregates assemble into mature Tau filaments when Zn2+ has been chelated by EDTA. Unlike wild-type Tau244-372, low micromolar concentrations of Zn2+ have no obvious effects on fibrillization kinetics of single mutants C291A and C322A and double mutant C291A/C322A under reducing conditions. The results from isothermal titration calorimetry show that one Zn2+ binds to one Tau molecule via tetrahedral coordination to Cys-291 and Cys-322 as well as two histidines, with moderate, micromolar affinity. Our data demonstrate that low micromolar zinc accelerates the fibrillization of human Tau protein via bridging Cys-291 and Cys-322 in physiological reducing conditions, providing clues to understanding the relationship between zinc dyshomeostasis and the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases.
MiR-125b regulates the proliferation of glioblastoma stem cells by targeting E2F2. microRNAs (miRNAs) play important role in regulating cancer stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, but the expression prolife of miRNAs in glioma stem cells (GSCs) has not been addressed. Here, we found that CD133 positive GSCs possess a unique miRNAs profile compared to CD133 negative glioblastoma cells. miR-125b, as one of neuronal miRNAs, is the most significantly down-regulated miRNAs and overexpression of miR-125b inhibits the proliferation of CD133 positive GSCs and reduces the expression of "stem" marker. Furthermore, two binding sites for miR-125b are identified in the 3′UTR of E2F2 and overexpression of miR-125b in CD133 positive GSCs represses the endogenous level of E2F2 protein. This study demonstrated that miR-125b plays important roles in regulating the proliferation of GSCs by directly targeting E2F2.
Transforming growth factors β1, β2, and β3 and their receptors are differentially regulated during normal and impaired wound healing. A series of studies has shown that application of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) to a wound has a beneficial effect, especially in animals with wound healing disorders. In this study we have investigated the regulation of TGF-β1,β2, and β3 and their receptors during the repair process. We found a large induction of all three TGF-β isoforms and also of TGF-β types I and II receptors, although the time course of induction and the absolute expression levels were different for these genes. Furthermore, each TGF-β isoform had distinct sites of expression in the wound. Systemic treatment with glucocorticoids significantly altered the expression levels of TGF-βs and TGF-β receptors. Whereas expression of TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β type II receptor was suppressed by glucocorticoids in normal and wounded skin, expression of TGF-β3 and TGF-β receptor type I mRNA was stimulated. These findings provide an explanation for the beneficial effect of exogenous TGF-β in the treatment of impaired wound healing in glucocorticoid-treated animals. Furthermore, they suggest that a disturbed balance between the levels of the three TGF-β isoforms and their receptors might underlie the wound healing defect seen in glucocorticoid-treated animals.
Cbl-b gene silencing enhances H9 T lymphocyte-mediated killing of human laryngeal squamous cancer Hep-2 cells. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of sputum ubiquitin ligase (Cbl-b) gene known-down on the cytotoxicity of H9 T lymphocytes against human laryngeal squamous cancer Hep-2 cells and explore the underlying mechanism. METHODS: CD4+ T lymphocytes isolated from 12 patients with laryngeal squamous carcinoma and 12 healthy individuals were examined for Cbl-b mRNA expressions using RT-PCR. H9 T lymphocytes cultured in 96-well plates were transfected with Cbl-b siRNA via liposomes followed by treatment with an anti-IL-2 monoclonal antibody, with H9 T lymphocytes transfected with a scrambled sequence as the negative control. The expressions of Cbl-b mRNA and protein in the cells were detected using real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The killing effect of the treated T lymphocytes against Hep-2 cells was assessed using the cell counting kit (CCK-8). The positive expression rates of CD69 and CD25 on the surface of H9 T lymphocytes were determined using flow cytometry, and the levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (INF-γ) in the culture supernatants of H9 T lymphocytes were detected with ELISA. RESULTS: The CD4+ T lymphocytes from patients with laryngeal squamous carcinoma showed significantly increased Cbl-b mRNA level compared with those from healthy individuals (P &lt; 0.05). Transfection of H9 T lymphocytes with Cbl-b siRNA significantly reduced the expression levels of Cbl-b mRNA and protein (P &lt; 0.05), which were not significantly affected by subsequent treatment of the cells with the anti-IL-2 antibody (P&gt;0.05). At different target-effector ratios, the Cbl-b siRNA-transfected cells showed significantly higher Hep-2 cell killing rates and higher positivity rates of CD69 and CD25 expressions than the blank and negative control cells and the cells with both Cbl-b siRNA transfection and anti-IL-2 treatment (P &lt; 0.05). Cbl-b silencing in H9 T lymphocytes resulted in significantly increased levels of IL-2 and INF-γ in the supernatant as compared with those in the blank and negative control groups (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Cbl-b gene silencing effectively enhances the killing effect of H9 T lymphocytes against Hep-2 cells in vitro probably as the result of enhanced IL-2 secretion and T lymphocyte activation.
Rab44, a novel large Rab GTPase, negatively regulates osteoclast differentiation by modulating intracellular calcium levels followed by NFATc1 activation. Rab44 is an atypical Rab GTPase that contains some additional domains such as the EF-hand and coiled-coil domains as well as Rab-GTPase domain. Although Rab44 genes have been found in mammalian genomes, no studies concerning Rab44 have been reported yet. Here, we identified Rab44 as an upregulated protein during osteoclast differentiation. Knockdown of Rab44 by small interfering RNA promotes RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation of the murine monocytic cell line, RAW-D or of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs). In contrast, overexpression of Rab44 prevents osteoclast differentiation. Rab44 was localized in the Golgi complex and lysosomes, and Rab44 overexpression caused an enlargement of early endosomes. A series of deletion mutant studies of Rab44 showed that the coiled-coil domain and lipidation sites of Rab44 is important for regulation of osteoclast differentiation. Mechanistically, Rab44 affects nuclear factor of activated T-cells c1 (NFATc1) signaling in RANKL-stimulated macrophages. Moreover, Rab44 depletion caused an elevation in intracellular Ca2+ transients upon RANKL stimulation, and particularly regulated lysosomal Ca2+ influx. Taken together, these results suggest that Rab44 negatively regulates osteoclast differentiation by modulating intracellular Ca2+ levels followed by NFATc1 activation.
Histamine augments interleukin-2 production and the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Histamine (0.5 g/kg) was found to augment the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vivo, if injected in the late phase (day 4) of the response. The production of interleukin-2 in concanavalin A-activated spleen cell cultures was also strongly augmented by 1 × 10-2 M histamine or by a combination of 2 × 10-3 M histamine and histamine (diamine oxidase). This suggests the possibility that the augmentation in vivo is mediated by the oxidized histamine derivative imidazolylacetaldehyde, since diamine oxidase occurs in many tissues. The interleukin-2-dependent proliferation of a T cell clone, on the other hand, was not affected by histamine with or without diamine oxidase. The experiments suggest that histamine supports the late phase of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte response by augmenting the interleukin-2 production.
Predictive value of long non-coding RNA intersectin 1-2 for occurrence and in-hospital mortality of severe acute pancreatitis. Background: This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of long non-coding RNA intersectin 1-2 (lnc-ITSN1-2) for severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) risk, and its correlation with disease severity and in-hospital mortality in SAP patients. Methods: Plasma samples from 60 SAP, 60 moderate-severe acute pancreatitis (MSAP) and 60 mild acute pancreatitis (MAP) patients were collected within 24\xa0hours, and plasma samples from 60 age and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) were collected when enrollment. Lnc-ITSN1-2 was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In AP patients, disease severity was evaluated and in-hospital deaths were recorded. Results: Lnc-ITSN1-2 was increased in SAP patients compared with MSAP, MAP patients, and HCs, and it is well-discriminated SAP patients from MSAP patients (area under curve (AUC): 0.699, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.605-0.792), MAP patients (AUC: 0.862, 95% CI: 0.798-0.926), and HCs (AUC: 0.958, 95% CI: 0.925-0.990). For disease severity, lnc-ITSN1-2 was positively correlated with Ranson's score, acute pathologic and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and C-reactive protein (CRP) in SAP patients, MSAP patients, and MAP patients; meanwhile, the correlation coefficients were highest in SAP patients. Furthermore, lnc-ITSN1-2 displayed a good predictive value for increased in-hospital mortality in SAP (AUC: 0.803, 95% CI: 0.673-0.933) and MSAP (AUC: 0.854, 95% CI: 0.752-0.956) patients, which was similar with several common prognostic factors (including Ranson's score, APACHE II score, SOFA score, and CRP). Conclusion: Lnc-ITSN1-2 might be a potential biomarker for discrimination of SAP to improve the prognosis of SAP patients.
Structural characterization of the extracellular domain of caSPR2 and insights into its association with the novel ligand contactin1. Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2) encodes for CASPR2, a multidomain single transmembrane protein belonging to the neurexin superfamily that has been implicated in a broad range of human phenotypes including autism and language impairment. Using a combination of biophysical techniques, including small angle x-ray scattering, single particle electron microscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, and biolayer interferometry, we present novel structural and functional data that relate the architecture of the extracellular domain of CASPR2 to a previously unknown ligand, Contactin1 (CNTN1). Structurally, CASPR2 is highly glycosylated and has an overall compact architecture. Functionally, we show that CASPR2 associates with micromolar affinity with CNTN1 but, under the same conditions, it does not interact with any of the other members of the contactin family. Moreover, by using dissociated hippocampal neurons we show that microbeads loaded with CASPR2, but not with a deletion mutant, co-localize with transfected CNTN1, suggesting that CNTN1 is an endogenous ligand for CASPR2. These data provide novel insights into the structure and function of CASPR2, suggesting a complex role of CASPR2 in the nervous system.
Telomere dysfunction and tumour suppression: The senescence connection. Long-lived organisms such as humans have evolved several intrinsic tumour suppressor mechanisms to combat the slew of oncogenic somatic mutations that constantly arise in proliferating stem-cell compartments. One of these anticancer barriers is the telomere, a specialized nucleoprotein complex that caps the ends of eukaryotic chromosome. Impaired telomere function activates the canonical DNA damage response pathway that engages p53 to initiate apoptosis or replicative senescence. Here, we discuss how p53-dependent senescence induced by dysfunctional telomeres may be as potent as apoptosis in suppressing tumorigenesis in vivo.
Connection lost, mam: Errors in er–mitochondria connections in neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondria associated membranes (MAMs), as the name suggests, are the membranes that physically and biochemically connect mitochondria with endoplasmic reticulum. MAMs not only structurally but also functionally connect these two important organelles within the cell which were previously thought to exist independently. There are multiple points of communication between ER–mitochondria and MAMs play an important role in both ER and mitochondria functions such as Ca2+ homeostasis, proteostasis, mitochondrial bioenergetics, movement, and mitophagy. The number of disease-related proteins and genes being associated with MAMs has been continually on the rise since its discovery. There is an overwhelming overlap between the biochemical functions of MAMs and processes affected in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington’s disease (HD). Thus, MAMs have received well-deserving and much delayed attention as modulators for ER–mitochondria communication and function. This review briefly discusses the recent progress made in this now fast developing field full of promise for very exciting future therapeutic discoveries.
Long noncoding ribonucleic acids maternally expressed gene 3 inhibits lung cancer tumor progression through downregulation of MYC. OBJECTIVE: Long noncoding ribonucleic acids (RNAs) nowadays emerge as important biomarkers or potential therapeutic targets discussed in human cancers. Among them, maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is known to be decreased in a variety of malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect the expression of MEG3 in forty pairs of lung cancer (LC) tissues. Overexpression of MEG3 was carried out, and we determined its effect on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration evaluated by cell counting kit-8, flow cytometric, and transwell analysis. Messenger RNA and protein expression of MYC were determined by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. RESULTS: The expression of MEG3 was downregulated in LC tissues. Forced expression of MEG3 led to reduced abilities of cell proliferation and elevated apoptosis rate. It also slightly inhibited cell migration capacity in vitro. In addition, MYC was inhibited by MEG3 overexpression at both transcriptional and translational levels. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed MEG3 could regulate LC progression and serve as an important target for LC treatment.
Levels of S100B protein drive the reparative process in acute muscle injury and muscular dystrophy. Regeneration of injured skeletal muscles relies on a tightly controlled chain of cellular and molecular events. We show that appropriate levels of S100B protein are required for timely muscle regeneration after acute injury. S100B released from damaged myofibers and infiltrating macrophages expands the myoblast population, attracts macrophages and promotes their polarization into M2 (pro-regenerative) phenotype, and modulates collagen deposition, by interacting with RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end-products) or FGFR1 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 1) depending on the muscle repair phase and local conditions. However, persistence of high S100B levels compromises the regeneration process prolonging myoblast proliferation and macrophage infiltration, delaying M1/M2 macrophage transition, and promoting deposition of fibrotic tissue via RAGE engagement. Interestingly, S100B is released in high abundance from degenerating muscles of mdx mice, an animal model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and blocking S100B ameliorates histopathology. Thus, levels of S100B differentially affect skeletal muscle repair upon acute injury and in the context of muscular dystrophy, and S100B might be regarded as a potential molecular target in DMD.
The STATus of PD-L1 (B7-H1) on tolerogenic APCs. Expression by DCs of co-inhibitory molecules such as programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1/B7-H1/CD274), a member of the B7 superfamily, is crucial for the downregulation of T-cell responses and the maintenance of immune homeostasis. Exposure of immature DCs to danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPS) or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) generally results in their maturation and acquisition of immunostimulatory function. However, exposure of DCs to TLR ligands early during their differentiation can inhibit further differentiation and confer tolerogenic properties on these APCs. A report in this issue of The European Journal of Immunology reveals that early inhibition of human DC differentiation from blood monocytes by TLR agonists is associated with a tolerogenic phenotype and Treg generation. The tolerogenic function of these APCs is dependent on MAPK-induced IL-6 and IL-10 production, which drives STAT-3-mediated PD-L1 expression. These observations link IL-10 and IL-6 to PD-L1 expression, providing a new dimension to the anti-inflammatory properties of these cytokines. These findings also have implications for understanding the inherent function of DCs in non-lymphoid tissues such as the liver and lung, where they are exposed to PAMPs that are found constitutively in the local microenvironment.
Cloning and characterization of AOEB166, a novel mammalian antioxidant enzyme of the peroxiredoxin family. Using two-dimensional electrophoresis, we have recently identified in human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid a novel protein, termed B166, with a molecular mass of 17 kDa. Here, we report the cloning of human and rat cDNAs encoding B166, which has been renamed AOEB166 for antioxidant enzyme B166. Indeed, the deduced amino acid sequence reveals that AOEB166 represents a new mammalian subfamily of AhpC/TSA peroxiredoxin antioxidant enzymes. Human AOEB166 shares 63% similarity with Escherichia coli AhpC22 alkyl hydroperoxide reductase and 66% similarity with a recently identified Saccharomyces cerevisiae alkyl hydroperoxide reductase/thioredoxin peroxidase. Moreover, recombinant AOEB166 expressed in E. coli exhibits a peroxidase activity, and an antioxidant activity comparable with that of catalase was demonstrated with the glutamine synthetase protection assay against dithiothreitol/Fe3+/O2 oxidation. The analysis of AOEB166 mRNA distribution in 30 different human tissues and in 10 cell lines shows that the gene is widely expressed in the body. Of interest, the analysis of N- and C-terminal domains of both human and rat AOEB166 reveals amino acid sequences presenting features of mitochondrial and peroxisomal targeting sequences. Furthermore, human AOEB166 expressed as a fusion protein with GFP in HepG2 cell line is sorted to these organelles. Finally, acute inflammation induced in rat lung by lipopolysaccharide is associated with an increase of AOEB166 mRNA levels in lung, suggesting a protective role for AOEB166 in oxidative and inflammatory processes.
The opposing and complimentary roles of IL-4 and TGF-β in directing programs of T cell differentiation. T cells are well adapted to sense and respond to cues from their environment. Cytokine cues are particularly important when T cells are first activated. During their initial activation, the cytokine milieu directs the differentiation of T cells towards a particular T helper program while suppressing other fates. Production of T helper-specific cytokines by naive T cell must be prevented to force their dependence on outside cues. If these cues are not provided, or are inappropriately interpreted, the immune response will fail to develop appropriately. This could result in excessive stimulation, and lead to allergy or autoimmunity. In contrast, inadequate responses could lead to immunodeficiency. In this review, we illustrate this dichotomy using TGF-β and IL-4, two cytokines that, when delivered in the presence of IL-2, can drive cells towards the inducible regulatory T (iTreg) cell or the T H2 cell program. Interestingly, TGF-β and IL-4 antagonize one another and actively suppress the differentiation program induced by the other. Furthermore, the combination of the two signals drives T cells to adopt a different helper program that is characterized by production of the cytokine IL-9, thus defining them as TH9 cells. Recent data has revealed key mechanisms by which IL-4 and TGF- β promote and/or suppress TH2 and iTreg cell differentiation programs. Additionally, the molecular pathways that result from the cooperation of TGF-β and IL-4, resulting in TH9 generation, have been recently defined. We will integrate these new findings and discuss how defects in pathways that help T cells interpret these external cues lead to inappropriate immune responses and can have deleterious consequences.
Heat Stress-induced Protein Glycosylation in Mammalian Cells. The cellular stress response is a model for the regulation of gene expression and represents a highly conserved mechanism for cells that respond to a changing environment. The cellular stress response includes a significant glycobiological component, which although not well characterized, appears essential and complementary to the role of “classical” heat shock proteins (HSPs). This review concentrates on the glycobiological component of the mammalian stress response, where several major heat stress-induced glycoproteins have been identified to date. For example, the expression and glycosyl-ation of GP50 and GP62 is associated with the development of thermotolerance, while P-SG67 and P-SG64 are glycosylated “promptly”, i.e., within minutes after the initiation of heat stress. GP50 in CHO cells is homologous to the serpin family-related retinoic acid-inducible mouse J6 gene product, whereas P-SG67 and P-SG64 are glycosylated variants of the multifunctional ER protein, calreticulin. Potential functions for stress glycoproteins and their possible interaction with HSPs are discussed. The availability of molecular probes for stress glycoproteins should facilitate studies to understand their functions and to utilize them in biotechnological applications.
LINCing Defective Nuclear-Cytoskeletal Coupling and DYT1 Dystonia. Mechanical forces generated by nuclear-cytoskeletal coupling through the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, an evolutionarily conserved molecular bridge in the nuclear envelope (NE), are critical for the execution of wholesale nuclear positioning events in migrating and dividing cells, chromosome dynamics during meiosis, and mechanotransduction. LINC complexes consist of outer Klarsicht, ANC-1, and Syne homology (KASH) and inner Sad1, UNC-84 (SUN) nuclear membrane proteins. KASH proteins interact with the cytoskeleton in the cytoplasm and SUN proteins in the perinuclear space of the NE. In the nucleoplasm, SUN proteins interact with A-type nuclear lamins and chromatin-binding proteins. Recent structural insights into the KASH-SUN interaction have generated several questions regarding how LINC complex assembly and function might be regulated within the perinuclear space. Here we discuss potential LINC regulatory mechanisms and focus on the potential role of the ATPases associated with various cellular activities (AAA+) protein, torsinA, as a LINC complex regulator within the NE. We also examine how defects in LINC complex regulation by torsinA may contribute to the pathogenesis of the human neurological movement disorder, DYT1 dystonia.
Recurrent intragenic rearrangements of EGFR and BRAF in soft tissue tumors of infants. Soft tissue tumors of infancy encompass an overlapping spectrum of diseases that pose unique diagnostic and clinical challenges. We studied genomes and transcriptomes of cryptogenic congenital mesoblastic nephroma (CMN), and extended our findings to five anatomically or histologically related soft tissue tumors: infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS), nephroblastomatosis, Wilms tumor, malignant rhabdoid tumor, and clear cell sarcoma of the kidney. A key finding is recurrent mutation of EGFR in CMN by internal tandem duplication of the kinase domain, thus delineating CMN from other childhood renal tumors. Furthermore, we identify BRAF intragenic rearrangements in CMN and IFS. Collectively these findings reveal novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic strategies and highlight a prominent role of isolated intragenic rearrangements as drivers of infant tumors.
Genetic predisposition to neuroblastoma mediated by a LMO1 super-enhancer polymorphism. Neuroblastoma is a paediatric malignancy that typically arises in early childhood, and is derived from the developing sympathetic nervous system. Clinical phenotypes range from localized tumours with excellent outcomes to widely metastatic disease in which long-term survival is approximately 40% despite intensive therapy. A previous genome-wide association study identified common polymorphisms at the LMO1 gene locus that are highly associated with neuroblastoma susceptibility and oncogenic addiction to LMO1 in the tumour cells. Here we investigate the causal DNA variant at this locus and the mechanism by which it leads to neuroblastoma tumorigenesis. We first imputed all possible genotypes across the LMO1 locus and then mapped highly associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) to areas of chromatin accessibility, evolutionary conservation and transcription factor binding sites. We show that SNP rs2168101 G>T is the most highly associated variant (combined P = 7.47 × 10-29, odds ratio 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.60-0.70), and resides in a super-enhancer defined by extensive acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 within the first intron of LMO1. The ancestral G allele that is associated with tumour formation resides in a conserved GATA transcription factor binding motif. We show that the newly evolved protective TATA allele is associated with decreased total LMO1 expression (P = 0.028) in neuroblastoma primary tumours, and ablates GATA3 binding (P < 0.0001). We demonstrate allelic imbalance favouring the G-containing strand in tumours heterozygous for this SNP, as demonstrated both by RNA sequencing (P < 0.0001) and reporter assays (P = 0.002). These findings indicate that a recently evolved polymorphism within a super-enhancer element in the first intron of LMO1 influences neuroblastoma susceptibility through differential GATA transcription factor binding and direct modulation of LMO1 expression in cis, and this leads to an oncogenic dependency in tumour cells.
Deletions of 12p in hematological malignancies. Deletions and rearrangements of the short arms of chromosome 12 are frequent chromosomal changes in patients with haematological malignancies. The loss of genetic material in tumour cells is usually indicative of the inactivation of genes with tumour suppressor function. The region of 12p has been largely studied by molecular genetic and molecular cytogenetic methods to identify the tumour suppressor genes included in leukemogenesis. The gene TEL/ETV6 is not classical tumour suppressor gene but it is often deleted or rearranged in variety of hematological malignancies. In this study we present a group of 10 patients with deletion del(12)(p) found by conventional cytogenetic analyses. Patient's diagnoses were either lymphoid or myeloid leukaemias. We applied molecular-cytogenetic methods (fluorescence in situ hybridization- FISH) with locus-specific probe LSI TEL/AML1 to assess deletion of TEL/ETV6 gene on 12p. To exclude translocations of 12p we use FISH with whole chromosome painting probe for chromosome 12 and mFISH in patients with complex karyotype. Deletion of TEL/ETV6 was found in five of eight examined patients. No translocations of 12p were confirmed. The region closely linked to this gene probably contains one or more genes (tumour suppressors) which play the role in progression of oncogenesis. We suppose that in patients with unconfirmed deletion of TEL/ETV6 other genes with tumour suppressor function were inactivated.
Regulation of Mcl-1 Expression in Context to Bone Marrow Stromal Microenvironment in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. A growing body of evidence suggests that the resistance of CLL cells to apoptosis is partly mediated through the interactions between leukemia cells and adjacent stromal cells residing in the lymphatic tissue or bone marrow microenvironment. Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic protein that is associated with failure to treatment is up-regulated in CLL lymphocytes after interaction with microenvironment. However, the regulation of its expression in context to microenvironment is unclear. We evaluated and compared changes in Mcl-1 in CLL B-cells in suspension culture and when co-cultured on stromal cells. The blockade of apoptosis in co-cultured CLL cells is associated with diminution in caspase-3 and PARP cleavage and is not dependent on cytogenetic profile or prognostic factors of the disease. Stroma-derived resistance to apoptosis is associated with a cascade of transcriptional events such as increase in levels of total RNA Pol II and its phosphorylation at Ser2 and Ser5, increase in the rate of global RNA synthesis, and amplification of Mcl-1 transcript levels. The latter is associated with increase in Mcl-1 protein level without an impact on the levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Post-translational modifications of protein kinases show increased phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, Erk at Thr202/Tyr204 and Gsk-3β at Ser9 and augmentation of total Mcl-1 accumulation along with phosphorylation at Ser159/Thr163 sites. Collectively, stroma-induced apoptosis resistance is mediated through signaling proteins that regulate transcriptional and translational expression and post-translational modification of Mcl-1 in CLL cells in context to bone marrow stromal microenvironment.
Establishment of In Vitro Models by Stress-Induced Premature Senescence for Characterizing the Stromal Vascular Niche in Human Adipose Tissue. Acting as the largest energy reservoir in the body, adipose tissue is involved in longevity and progression of age-related metabolic dysfunction. Here, cellular senescence plays a central role in the generation of a pro-inflammatory environment and in the evolution of chronic diseases. Within the complexity of a tissue, identification and targeting of senescent cells is hampered by their heterogeneity. In this study, we generated stress-induced premature senescence 2D and 3D in vitro models for the stromal vascular niche of human adipose tissue. We established treatment conditions for senescence induction using Doxorubicin (Dox), starting from adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASCs), which we adapted to freshly isolated microtissue-stromal vascular fraction (MT-SVF), where cells are embedded within their native extracellular matrix. Senescence hallmarks for the established in vitro models were verified on different cellular levels, including morphology, cell cycle arrest, senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity (SA-βgal) and gene expression. Two subsequent exposures with 200 nM Dox for six days were suitable to induce senescence in our in vitro models. We demonstrated induction of senescence in the 2D in vitro models through SA-βgal activity, at the mRNA level (LMNB1, CDK1, p21) and additionally by G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in ASCs. Significant differences in Lamin B1 and p21 protein expression confirmed senescence in our MT-SVF 3D model. MT-SVF 3D cultures were composed of multiple cell types, including CD31, CD34 and CD68 positive cells, while cell death remained unaltered upon senescence induction. As heterogeneity and complexity of adipose tissue senescence is given by multiple cell types, our established senescence models that represent the perivascular niche embedded within its native extracellular matrix are highly relevant for future clinical studies.
Oxidation of low density lipoprotein by mesangial cells may promote glomerular injury. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) deposition and local oxidation play a key role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and may likewise contribute to glomerular injury. These studies were designed to determine whether cultured human mesangial cells oxidize homologous LDL and to compare the effects of unmodified and oxidized lipoprotein on cell proliferation, viability and eicosanoid production. Cell-mediated lipoprotein oxidation was demonstrated and could be suppressed by oxygen free radical scavengers and inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism. When incubated with cells, oxidized LDL (Ox- LDL) at concentrations up to and including 100 μg/ml reduced 3H-thymidine incorporation without causing cytotoxicity as assessed by lactate dehydrogenase release. Under the same conditions there was a concentration- dependent increase in the synthesis of prostaglandins E2, 6-keto-PGF(1α) and thromboxane B2. In contrast, unmodified LDL enhanced DNA synthesis at concentrations less than 40 μg/ml and had little effect on eicosanoid production. These results demonstrate that exogenous oxidized LDL inhibits mesangial cell proliferation and increases eicosanoid synthesis. Unmodified lipoprotein can be directly oxidized by these cells through mechanisms that involve generation of oxygen free radicals.
Natural Small Molecules Targeting NF-κB Signaling in Glioblastoma. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a transcription factor that regulates various genes that mediate various cellular activities, including propagation, differentiation, motility, and survival. Abnormal activation of NF-κB is a common incidence in several cancers. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive brain cancer described by high cellular heterogeneity and almost unavoidable relapse following surgery and resistance to traditional therapy. In GBM, NF-κB is abnormally activated by various stimuli. Its function has been associated with different processes, including regulation of cancer cells with stem-like phenotypes, invasion of cancer cells, and radiotherapy resistance identification of mesenchymal cells. Even though multimodal therapeutic approaches such as surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapeutic drugs are used for treating GBM, however; the estimated mortality rate for GBM patients is around 1\xa0year. Therefore, it is necessary to find out new therapeutic approaches for treating GBM. Many studies are focusing on therapeutics having less adverse effects owing to the failure of conventional chemotherapy and targeted agents. Several studies of compounds suggested the involvement of NF-κB signaling pathways in the growth and development of a tumor and GBM cell apoptosis. In this review, we highlight the involvement of NF-κB signaling in the molecular understanding of GBM and natural compounds targeting NF-κB signaling.
Identification of the human klotho gene and its two transcripts encoding membrane and secreted klotho protein. Inactivation of the klotho (kl) gene in mice results in multiple disorders that resemble human aging. The mouse kl gene encodes a novel single-pass membrane protein with homology to β-glucosidases. In this study, we have isolated a human homologue of the kl gene and determined its gene structure. The human kl gene is composed of 5 exons and ranges over 50 kb on chromosome 13q12. We have further identified two transcripts that encode a membrane or secreted protein. These transcripts arise from a single kl gene through alternative RNA splicing. Expression of the putative secreted form predominates over that of the membrane form. The present study provides fundamental information necessary for further analyses of the human kl gene and its functions.
Regulation of retinoblastoma protein activity by the c terminal domain. Purpose. The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) is a iumor suppressor that regulates cell proliferation by controlling cellular transition from Gl to S phase of the cell cycle. The A-B pocket of Rb forms a transcriptional represser motif which is regulated through phosphorylation of the C-terminal of Rb. We examined the mechanism of C-terminal regulation of the A-B pocket. Methods. Transient iransfections of plasmids expressing GAL4-R5 or LexA-Rb fusion proteins in C33A (Rb-t cells, and detection of transcriptional activity using a reporter plasmid containing the chloramphenico! acetyttransferase (CAT) gene, SV40 promoter, and GAL4 or LexA binding sites. Results. Overexpression of the A-B pocket as a GAL4 or LexA fusion protein resulted in repression of CAT activity. Coexpression of the C-terminal domain on a separate protein blocked this transcriptional repression. Conclusions. Since the C-terminal can block transcriptional repression by the A-B pocket when expressed on a separate protein, the mechanism of C-terminal regulation may depend on interdomain interactions, rather than intramolecular conformational changes.
Altered sirtuin expression is associated with node-positive breast cancer. Sirtuins are genes implicated in cellular and organismal ageing. Consequently, they are speculated to be involved in diseases of ageing including cancer. Various cancers with widely differing prognosis have been shown to have differing and characteristic expression of these genes; however, the relationship between sirtuin expression and cancer progression is unclear. In order to correlate cancer progression and sirtuin expression, we have assessed sirtuin expression as a function of primary cell ageing and compared sirtuin expression in normal, 'nonmalignant' breast biopsies to breast cancer biopsies using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Levels of SIRT7 expression were significantly increased in breast cancer (P<0.0001). Increased levels of SIRT3 and SIRT7 transcription were also associated with node-positive breast cancer (P<0.05 and P<0.0001, respectively). This study has demonstrated differential sirtuin expression between nonmalignant and malignant breast tissue, with consequent diagnostic and therapeutic implications.
CD14+ monocytes repress gamma globin expression at early stages of erythropoiesis. In β-hemoglobinopathies, reactivation of gamma- at the expense of beta-globin is a prominent therapeutic option. Expression of the globin genes is not strictly intrinsically regulated during erythropoiesis, supported by the observation that fetal erythroid cells switch to adult hemoglobin expression when injected in mice. We show cultured erythroblasts are a mix of HbA restrictive and HbA/HbF expressing cells and that the proportion of cells in the latter population depends on the starting material. Cultures started from CD34+ cells contain more HbA/HbF expressing cells compared to erythroblasts cultured from total peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Depletion of CD14+ cells from PBMC resulted in higher HbF/HbA percentages. Conversely, CD34+ co-culture with CD14+ cells reduced the HbF/HbA population through cell–cell proximity, indicating that CD14+ actively repressed HbF expression in adult erythroid cultures. RNA-sequencing showed that HbA and HbA/HbF populations contain a limited number of differentially expressed genes, aside from HBG1/2. Co-culture of CD14+ cells with sorted uncommitted hematopoietic progenitors and CD34-CD36+ erythroblasts showed that hematopoietic progenitors prior to the hemoglobinized erythroid stages are more readily influenced by CD14+ cells to downregulate expression of HBG1/2, suggesting temporal regulation of these genes. This possibly provides a novel therapeutic avenue to develop β-hemoglobinopathies treatments.
Immune Cluster and PPI Network Analyses Identified CXCR3 as a Key Node of Immunoregulation in Head and Neck Cancer. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is significantly associated with clinical outcomes and therapeutic efficacy. However, the landscape of the head and neck cancer (HNC) microenvironment is not fully understood. Therefore, we divided HNCs into three classes according to differences in the TME to determine effective personalized treatments. We explored the immune landscape of head and neck cancer by analysing the gene expression profile of 501 cases from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal and validated our findings in 270 cases from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The levels of immune components in the tumor microenvironment were evaluated via single-sample gene set enrichment (ssGSEA) analysis. The HNCs were clustered into an Immunity-H group, Immunity-M group and Immunity-L group according to 40 immune components in the tumor microenvironment. DNA damage and HLA genes play an important role in immune regulation. The patients in the Immunity-H group had a favourable survival compared with patients in the Immunity-M group and the Immunity-L group. The patients in the Immunity-H group and Immunity-M group could benefit from radiotherapy. In addition, the Immunity-L group showed the lowest immunophenoscore and had poor response to anti-PD-1 treatment. CXCR3 was demonstrated to be downregulated in the Immunity-L group, which was related to shorter OS in the TCGA and GEO databases, suggesting CXCR3 as a potential therapeutic target. Taken together, our findings proposed three new microenvironment-related phenotypes of HNCs and suggested that CXCR3 played a major role in immune regulation and could be a novel therapeutic target, providing a reference for clinical decisions and research directions in the future.
Multimodal use of calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P in itch and acute pain uncovered by the elimination of vesicular glutamate transporter 2 from transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily v member 1 neurons. Primary afferents are known to use glutamate as their principal fast neurotransmitter. However, it has become increasingly clear that peptides have an influential role in both mediating and modulating sensory transmission. Herewedescribe the transmission accounting for different acute pain states and itch transmitted via the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) population by either ablating Trpv1–Cre-expressing neurons or inducing vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) deficiency in Trpv1–Cre-expressing neurons. Furthermore, by pharmacological inhibition of substance P or calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) signaling in Vglut2-deficient mice, we evaluated the contribution of substance P or CGRP to these sensory modulations, with or without the presence of VGLUT2-mediated glutamatergic transmission in Trpv1–Cre neurons. This examination, together with c-Fos analyses, showed that glutamate via VGLUT2 in the Trpv1–Cre population together with substance P mediate acute cold pain, whereas glutamate together with CGRP mediate noxious heat. Moreover, we demonstrate that glutamate together with both substance P and CGRP mediate tissue-injuryassociated pain.Wefurther show that itch, regulatedbythe VGLUT2-mediated transmission via the Trpv1–Cre population, depends on CGRP and gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) transmission because pharmacological blockade ofthe CGRPorGRPR pathway,orgenetic ablationofGrpr, ledtoadrastically attenuateditch. Our study reveals how different neurotransmitterscombinedcan cooperate with each other to transmit or regulate various acute sensations, including itch.
Extracellular vesicle-mediated endothelial apoptosis and EV-associated proteins correlate with COVID-19 disease severity. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has lead to a global pandemic with a rising toll in infections and deaths. Better understanding of its pathogenesis will greatly improve the outcomes and treatment of affected patients. Here we compared the inflammatory and cardiovascular disease-related protein cargo of circulating large and small extracellular vesicles (EVs) from 84 hospitalized patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with different stages of disease severity. Our findings reveal significant enrichment of proinflammatory, procoagulation, immunoregulatory and tissue-remodelling protein signatures in EVs, which remarkably distinguished symptomatic COVID-19 patients from uninfected controls with matched comorbidities and delineated those with moderate disease from those who were critically ill. Specifically, EN-RAGE, followed by TF and IL-18R1, showed the strongest correlation with disease severity and length of hospitalization. Importantly, EVs from COVID-19 patients induced apoptosis of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells in the order of disease severity. In conclusion, our findings support a role for EVs in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease and underpin the development of EV-based approaches to predicting disease severity, determining need for patient hospitalization and identifying new therapeutic targets.
Haplotypes of P2RX7 gene polymorphisms are associated with both cold pain sensitivity and analgesic effect of fentanyl. The P2X7 receptor is a member of the P2X family of adenosine 5'-triphosphate-gated cation channels. Several recent studies have demonstrated that this receptor is involved in mechanisms related to pain and inflammation. However, unknown is whether polymorphisms of the P2RX7 gene that encodes the human P2X7 receptor influence pain sensitivity and analgesic effects of opioids. The P2RX7 gene is known to be highly polymorphic. Thus, the present study examined associations between fentanyl sensitivity and polymorphisms in the P2RX7 gene in 355 Japanese patients who underwent painful orofacial cosmetic surgery. Results: We first conducted linkage disequilibrium (LD) analyses for 55 reported single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the region within and around the P2RX7 gene using genomic samples from 100 patients. In our samples, 42 SNPs were polymorphic, and a total of five LD blocks with six Tag SNPs (rs2708092, rs1180012, rs1718125, rs208293, rs1718136, and rs7132846) were observed. Thus, we further analyzed associations between genotypes/haplotypes of these Tag SNPs and clinical data using a total of 355 samples. In the genotype-based association study, only the rs1718125 G > A SNP tended to be associated with higher pain scores on a visual analog scale 24h after surgery (VAS24). The haplotype-based association study showed that subjects with homozygous haplotype No.3 (GTAAAC; estimated frequency: 15.0%) exhibited significantly higher cold pain sensitivity and lower analgesic effects of fentanyl for acute cold pain in the cold pressor test. Conversely, subjects who carried haplotype No.1 (ACGGAC; estimated frequency: 24.5%) tended to exhibit lower cold pain sensitivity and higher analgesic effects of fentanyl. Furthermore, subjects with homozygous haplotype No.2 (GCGGAC; estimated frequency: 22.9%) exhibited significantly lower VAS24 scores. Conclusions: Cold pain sensitivity and analgesic effects of fentanyl were related to the SNP and haplotypes of the P2RX7 gene. The patients with the rs1718125 G>A SNP tended to show higher VAS24 scores. Moreover, the combination of polymorphisms from the 5'-flanking region to exon 5 recessively affected cold pain sensitivity and analgesic effects of opioids for acute cold pain. The present findings shed light on the involvement of P2RX7 gene polymorphisms in naive cold pain sensitivity and analgesic effects of fentanyl.
Telomere length in human liver diseases. To determine the role of telomere-mediated gene stability in hepatocarcinogenesis, we examined the telomere length human liver without chronic liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). The mean telomere restriction fragment (TRF) length of normal liver (n = 13), chronic hepatitis (n = 11), liver cirrhosis (n = 24) and HCC (n = 24) was 7.8 ± 0.2, 7.1 ± 0.3, 6.4 ± 0.2 and 5.2 ± 0.2 kb, respectively (mean ± standard error). TRF length decreased with a progression of chronic liver diseases and that in HCC was significantly shorter than that in other chronic liver diseases (p < 0.05). The ratios of TRF length of HCC to that of corresponding surrounding liver of well differentiated (n = 7), moderately differentiated (n = 10) and poorly differentiated (n = 4) HCCs were 0.83 ± 0.06, 0.75 ± 0.05 and 0.98 ± 0.09, respectively. The ratio of poorly differentiated HCC was significantly higher than that of moderately differentiated HCC (p < 0.05). A comparison between the size and telomere length ratio of moderately differentiated HCCs revealed a decrease of the ratio with size until it reached 50 mm in diameter. In contrast, the ratio increased as the size enlarged over 50 mm. These findings suggest that the gene stability of the liver cells mediated by the telomere is reduced as chronic liver disease progresses and that telomerase is activated in poorly differentiated HCC and moderately differentiated HCC over 50 mm in diameter.
Pathological and clinical correlations in primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas: A series of 44 cases. Aims: histological and clinical relationship study of 44 cases of primary cutaneous B cell lymphoma, classified according to WHO classification. Materials and methods: histological, immunological and molecular analysis was correlated with clinical data. Results: 33 cases (75%) were marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MZL), with head and trunk predominance (median age = 54 years). Relapses in other mucosa-related sites occurred in 3 patients. Histological transformation implied a more aggressive treatment in 3 cases. A favorable outcome was observed in most cases. 9 (20%) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) appeared as a unique nodule, with female predominance (median age = 74 years) and 4 lymphoma-related deaths which seemed age-related (> 70 years) with only one lower limb localization. Histological aggressive features were present in 3 patients with a fatal outcome. 2 (5%) WHO grade 3 follicular lymphomas (FL) had an heterogeneous phenotype, with head localization, cutaneous relapses and good outcome. Conclusions: MZL, the predominant type, has a good prognosis, although transformation can occur, needing a more aggressive treatment. DLBCL, observed in older patients, has clinical and histological prognostic factors identical to extra-cutaneous lymphomas. FL appears rare and has an heterogeneous phenotype. Relationships with its nodal counterpart remains unclear.
Exosomal long non-coding RNA LIPCAR derived from oxLDL-treated THP-1 cells regulates the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human vascular smooth muscle cells. Background: It has been reported that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LIPCAR is involved in the progression of atherosclerosis. However, the mechanism underlying the effects of LIPCAR on regulating the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis remains unclear. Methods: Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was performed to detect the levels of LIPCAR in the plasma of patients with atherosclerosis and in THP-1 macrophages. THP-1 cells were stimulated with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) to induce foam cell formation. Furthermore, Transwell assay was carried out to evaluate the migration ability of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Results: The expression of LIPCAR in the plasma of patients with atherosclerosis was significantly higher compared with that in healthy subjects, while LIPCAR knockdown notably reversed ox-LDL-induced THP-1 cell apoptosis. In addition, LIPCAR was upregulated in exosomes derived from THP-1 cells treated with ox-LDL (THP-1/ox-LDL Exo). Furthermore, THP-1/ox-LDL Exo significantly increased the expression levels of CDK2 and proliferative cell nuclear antigen in human VSMCs, while these effects were reversed following LIPCAR silencing. Conclusion: The results of the present study suggested that exosomal lncRNA LIPCAR derived from ox-LDL modified THP-1 cells could promote the progression of atherosclerosis. Therefore, LIPCAR may be considered as a novel biomarker for the development of new strategies to treat atherosclerosis.
Expression of the promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger in T-lymphoblastic lymphoma and leukemia has strong implications for their cellular origin and greater association with initial bone marrow involvement. The promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger (PLZF) is essential for the development of innate T cells (as represented by natural killer T cells) for acquisition of their unique innate immune properties. We evaluated the PLZF protein expression in a variety of immature and mature lymphoid malignancies. PLZF was preferentially expressed in T-lymphoblastic lymphoma/acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-LBL/ALL) in 50% of the 54 cases. Among 51 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified, only one (2%) expressed PLZF. One mycosis fungoides case expressed PLZF in lymph node involved by tumor. Otherwise, PLZF was not detected in any other type of lymphoma. In T-LBL/ALL, PLZF expression was more common in CD4/CD8 double-negative (67%) or CD8 single-positive subtypes (73%) than in CD4/CD8 double-positive (13%) and CD4 single-positive subtypes (0%) (P0.001). Importantly, PLZF and CD1a expression were mutually exclusive in T-LBL/ALL (P0.001). This was also the case for T-cell receptor ΒF1 expression (P0.000). Most (96%) of the PLZF-positive T-LBL/ALL cases showed initial bone marrow involvement compared with 39% of PLZF-negative cases (P0.000). Based on these findings, we suggest that T-LBL/ALLs that express PLZF arise from early immature double-negative thymocytes when the T-cell receptor Β chain has not yet expressed or innate T-cell precursors, and strongly imply bone marrow involvement.
Caspase cleavage of the MET receptor generates an HGF interfering fragment. The MET tyrosine kinase receptor activated by its ligand HGF/SF, induces several cellular responses, including survival. Nonetheless, the MET receptor is cleaved in stress conditions by caspases within its intracellular region, generating a 40 kDa fragment, p40 MET, with pro-apoptotic properties. Here, we established that this cleavage splits the receptor at the juxtamembrane ESVD site, causing the concomitant generation of p100 MET, corresponding to the entire extracellular region of the MET receptor still spanning the membrane. This fragment is able to bind HGF/SF and to prevent HGF-dependent signaling downstream of full MET, demonstrating its function as a decoy receptor.
Modulation of ARTS and XIAP by Parkin Is Associated with Carnosic Acid Protects SH-SY5Y Cells against 6-Hydroxydopamine-Induced Apoptosis. The mediation of apoptosis-related protein in the TGF-β signaling pathway (ARTS) and X-liked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) by parkin plays a critical role in preventing Parkinson’s disease. We studied whether carnosic acid (CA) could prevent 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced apoptosis by modulating ARTS and XIAP through parkin in SH-SY5Y cells. In cells treated with 6-OHDA, the protein expression of ARTS is increased and XIAP is decreased. Pretreatment of cells with CA reversed these effects. Moreover, CA attenuated the activation of caspase 9 and caspase 7 by 6-OHDA. By immunoprecipitation with ARTS antibody, we found that 6-OHDA increased the protein expression of XIAP. However, pretreatment of cells with CA reduced XIAP protein and increased the ubiquitination of ARTS. Silencing of parkin attenuated the ability of CA to reverse the induction of ARTS and apoptotic-related proteins and the reduction of XIAP and parkin protein by 6-OHDA. Similarly, reversal of 6-OHDA-induced nuclear condensation and apoptotic-related proteins by CA was inhibited in cells with XIAP silencing. In conclusion, CA induces parkin by enhancing the ubiquitination of ARTS, leading to induction of XIAP. This may be a novel strategy for preventing Parkinson’s disease.
Serum proteomics links suppression of tumor immunity to ancestry and lethal prostate cancer. There is evidence that tumor immunobiology and immunotherapy response may differ between African American and European American prostate cancer patients. Here, we determine if men of African descent harbor a unique systemic immune-oncological signature and measure 82 circulating proteins in almost 3000 Ghanaian, African American, and European American men. Protein signatures for suppression of tumor immunity and chemotaxis are elevated in men of West African ancestry. Importantly, the suppression of tumor immunity protein signature associates with metastatic and lethal prostate cancer, pointing to clinical importance. Moreover, two markers, pleiotrophin and TNFRSF9, predict poor disease survival specifically among African American men. These findings indicate that immune-oncology marker profiles differ between men of African and European descent. These differences may contribute to the disproportionate burden of lethal prostate cancer in men of African ancestry. The elevated peripheral suppression of tumor immunity may have important implication for guidance of cancer therapy which could particularly benefit African American patients.
Cold preferentially down regulates β3-adrenergic receptor mRNA and signal transduction in brown adipose tissue of young compared with senescent rats. β3-adrencrgic receptor (β3AR) signal transduction declines with age in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Cold exposure restores β3AR responsiveness in senescent rats. To determine if cold exposure upregulates β3ARs and signal transduction, we examined β3AR mRNA and isoproterenol (ISO) and the β3-agonist, BRL 37344 (BRL) stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity (AC) in BAT from rats of 4 and 24 m of ages following 2-day cold exposure at 8°C. β3AR mRNA declined by 30% with age (100 ± 11 arbitrary units, 4m; 70 ± 8, 24 m, p <.05) and by 60% with cold exposure in the young (40 ± 5, p <.001). In contrast, cold did not alter β3AR mRNA in senescent rats (70 ± 9). β1AR mRNA levels were unchanged by age or cold exposure. AC stimulated by ISO (141 ± 15 vs 84 ± 4, pmol cAMP/mg/min) and BRL (107 ± 10 vs 66 ± 9) declined with age (p <.01). With cold, ISO AC declined by 40% (86 ± 8) and BRL AC by 75% (24 ± 6) in young but not in senescent (84 ± 4 vs 78 ± 6, ISO; 66 ± 9 vs 64 ± 11, BRL) rats. ISO AC dose response curves were resolved into β1AR and β3AR stimulatory components. In young rats, cold did not change the β1AR component but abolished the β3AR component. In senescent rats, total AC was less than in young, but there was no change in either the β1AR or β3AR components with cold. These data suggest that cold exposure desensitizes β3AR signal transduction and down regulates β3AR mRNA preferential in young rats. The lack of down regulation in senescent rats may be contributing to restoration of β3AR signal transduction following cold exposure in senescent rats.
Antisense oligonucleotides, a novel tool for the control of cytokine effects on human cartilage. focus on interleukins 1 and 6 and proteoglycan synthesis. Objective. To prevent the negative effects of interleukin–1 (IL–1) and IL–1—induced IL–6 on cartilage proteoglycan (PG) synthesis, we used an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) specific for IL–6 messenger RNA (mRNA) to inhibit IL–6 production. Methods. Explants of human articular cartilage were cultured in the presence or absence of IL–6—ASO, IL–1, and exogenous IL–6. As metabolic parameters, cartilage production of IL–6 was determined in the B9 bioassay and PG as incorporation of 35SO4. Results. The IL–6—ASO prevented IL–1—induced production of IL–6 in the cartilage explants, as well as IL–1—induced inhibition of PG synthesis. This inhibition was restored, despite the presence of IL–6—ASO, when exogenous IL–6 was added. A control ASO (not specific for IL–6 mRNA) was not effective. Conclusion. The IL–6—ASO used can penetrate the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage, enter the chondrocytes, and inhibit the IL–1—induced production of IL–6. Furthermore, IL–6—ASO can prevent the IL–1—induced inhibition of cartilage PG synthesis. The effect of exogenous IL–6 shows that IL–1 requires IL–6 for inhibition of PG synthesis.
The regulation of interferon type I pathway-related genes RSAD2 and ETV7 specifically indicates antibody-mediated rejection after kidney transplantation. Context: Antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) after kidney transplantation (KTx) remains the crucial obstacle to successful long-term graft function. The identification of gene signatures involved in ABMR could grant the basis for better prevention and treatment strategies. Objective: The identification of gene signatures in whole blood cells specific for ABMR after KTx. Materials and methods: Total RNA from blood cells of 16 kidney-transplanted patients with ABMR, stable graft function (SGF), and with T-cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) was isolated. Gene expression was determined by high-throughput sequencing followed by validation and analyses of differentially expressed candidates on mRNA level and on protein level in a large patient cohort (n\xa0=\xa0185) in patients with SGF, urinary tract infection (UTI), borderline rejection (BL), TCMR, ABMR, and interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. Results: From the 570 genes detected, 111 discriminated ABMR from SGF and TCMR. A distinct enrichment of interferon (IFN) type I and type II signature gene set was observed. The expression of candidate genes IFIT1, ETV7, and RSAD2 distinguished ABMR patients from patients with SGF and also TCMR, whereas ETV7 and RSAD2 differentiated ABMR also from BL. Conclusion: The IFN-inducible genes ETV7 and RSAD2 represent specific biomarkers for ABMR episodes after KTx.
Isoflurane exposure regulates the cell viability and BDNF expression of astrocytes via upregulation of TREK-1. Neonatal isoflurane exposure in rodents disrupts hippocampal cognitive functions, including learning and memory, and astrocytes may have an important role in this process. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this disruption are not fully understood. The present study investigated the role of TWIK-related K+ channel (TREK-1) in isoflurane-induced cognitive impairment. Lentiviruses were used to overexpress or knockdown TREK-1 in astrocytes exposed to increasing concentrations of isoflurane or O2 for 2 h. Subsequently, the mRNA and protein expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), caspase-3, Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) and TREK-1 was measured by reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. In addition, cell viability was assessed by a 2-(4-Iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium monosodium salt assay. The results demonstrated that, prior to manipulating TREK-1, isoflurane significantly decreased the cell viability and BDNF expression, and increased Bax, caspase-3 and TREK-1 expression was observed. However, TREK-1 overexpression in astrocytes significantly downregulated BDNF expression, and upregulated Bax and caspase-3 expression. Furthermore, lentiviral-mediated short hairpin RNA knockdown of TREK-1 effectively inhibited the isoflurane-induced changes in BDNF, Bax and caspase-3 expression. Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that isoflurane-induced cell damage in astrocytes may be associated with TREK-1-mediated inhibition of BDNF and provide a reference for the safe use of isoflurane anesthesia in infants and children.
Differential protein profiling as a potential multi-marker approach for obese patients with heart failure: A retrospective study. Identification of novel circulating biomarkers predicting death and major cardio-metabolic events in obese patients with heart failure (HF) remains a research priority. In this study, we compared multi-marker profile of non-obese (NOB) and obese (OB) HF patients in relation to mortality outcome. The new multiplex proximity extension assay technology was used to analyze the levels of 92 proteins in plasma samples from HF patients according to body mass index (BMI) categories. At 2-year follow-up, all-cause mortality rates were significantly greater in NOB patients (BMI < 30 kg/m2) compared to the OB patients (BMI > 30 kg/m2) with HF (odds ratio 26; 95% CI: 1.14-624, p < 0,04). Quantitative proteomic analysis revealed thirteen distinct proteins expression profiles of OB and NOB HF patients. Among these proteins, RAGE, CXCL6, CXCL1, CD40, NEMO, VEGF-A, KLK6, PECAM1, PAR1, MMP1, BNP and NTproBNP were down-regulated, whereas leptin was up-regulated in OB HF patients. In addition, an inverse correlation between plasma BNP levels and leptin in OB HF patients was observed (r = -0.58 p = 0.02). This study identifies specific plasma protein signature in OB and NOB patients with HF in relation to mortality outcome.
Mutation analysis of the p51 gene and correlation between p53, p73, and p51 expressions in prostatic carcinoma. BACKGROUND. p73 and p51 are genes possessing amino-acid similarities to p53. We previously found no mutation in p73 in prostatic carcinoma, but did find abnormal expression of the gene. Involvement of these genes in prostatic carcinogenesis is still poorly understood. METHODS. Mutation analysis of the p51 gene and allelotyping of 3q28, on which p51 lies, were performed. Expression of p53, p73, and p51 was examined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and expression levels were compared. RESULTS. No mutation in p51 was found (0/55 cases). Loss of heterozygosity at 3q28 was detected in 6 of 28 cases (21.8%). By expression analysis we found that in p53, 4 of 38 cases (10.5%) showed downregulation. No cases showed upregulation of p53. In contrast, p73 and p51 were downregulated in 42.1 and 39.5% of cases, respectively, and upregulated in 31.5 and 34.2% of cases, respectively. Expression levels of p51 corresponded with those of p73 in 25 of 38 cases (65.8%). CONCLUSIONS. Somatic mutations in p73 and p51 are not important in prostatic carcinogenesis. These genes may be associated with tumors by expression levels and may have roles in addition to tumor suppression.
Peripheral Blood Circular RNAs as a Biomarker for Major Depressive Disorder and Prediction of Possible Pathways. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are highly expressed in the central nervous system and have been reported to be associated with neuropsychiatric diseases, but their potential role in major depressive disorder (MDD) remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that there was a disorder of circRNAs in the blood of MDD patients. It has been preliminarily proved that hsa_circ_0002473, hsa_circ_0079651, hsa_circ_0137187, hsa_circ_0006010, and hsa_circ_0113010 were highly expressed in MDD patients and can be used as diagnostic markers for MDD. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that hsa_circ_0079651, hsa_circ_0137187, hsa_circ_0006010, and hsa_circ_0113010 may affect the neuroplasticity of MDD through the ceRNA mechanism.
Molecular profiling of lamellar ichthyosis pathogenic missense mutations on the structural and stability aspects of TGM1 protein. Lamellar ichthyosis (LI) is a rare inherited disease where affected infants present a extensive skin scaling characterized by hyperkeratosis. Inherited mutations in the Transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) protein is one of the known causative genetic factor for the LI. The main objective of this study is to explore the impact of LI causative missense mutations on the structural and stability aspects of TGM1 protein using structural modeling, molecular docking and molecular dynamics approaches. By testing all LI causative TMG1 mutations against multiple stability prediction methods, we found that L362R and L388P mutations positioned in the Transglut_core domain were most destabilizing to the stability of TGM1 protein. These 2 mutations were 3D protein modeled and further analyzed by molecular docking and dynamic simulation methods. Molecular docking of these TGM1 mutant structures with chitosan, a natural polyphenolic compound and known inducer for transglutaminase enzyme, has shown stable molecular interactions between the native TGM1-chitosan and TGM1(L388P)-chitosan complex, when compared to the TGM1(L362R)-chitosan complex. Interestingly, molecular dynamics analysis have also yielded similar findings, where L388P-chitosan complex is shown to develop B-sheets and attain better stability, whereas TGM1-L362R complex possessed coils over the simulation period, pointing its highly destabilizing behavior on the protein structure. This study concludes that missense mutations in Transglut_core domain of the TGM1 are deleterious to the stability and structural changes of TGM1 protein and also suggest that chitosan molecule could act as a natural activator against few pathogenic TGM1 mutations.
Genetic susceptibility to autoimmune thyroid diseases in a Chinese Han population: Role of vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms. Purpose: Previous studies have found that some immune-related genes were associated with autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs). A couple of studies have explored the association between vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to AITDs in different populations and found conflicting results. This case-control study was designed to evaluate the role of polymorphisms of VDR gene in the predisposition of AITDs in a Chinese Han population. Methods: A total of 417 patients with Graves' disease (GD), 250 patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and 301 healthy subjects were enrolled. The Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer (MALDI-TOF-MS) Platform was applied to detect four SNPs (rs1544410, rs2228570, rs731236 and rs7975232) in the VDR gene. Results: In the rs7975232 allele A frequency showed a significant increase in GD patients (30.34% vs. 25.42% in controls; P= 0.041, OR = 1.278, 95%CI = 1.010-1.617). However, no relationship was found between clinical phenotypes and the four SNPs. Conclusions: This result suggests that the VDR gene may be one susceptibility gene which contributes to the risk of GD.
Genomic imbalances in AIDS-related lymphomas: Relation with tumoral Epstein-Barr virus status. BACKGROUND: The pathologic heterogeneity of AIDS related lymphomas (ARL) reflects several pathogenic mechanisms: chronic antigenic stimulation, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, and genomic abnormalities. Genetic abnormalities, known to play a major role in lymphomas of non-immunocompromised patients, are not well characterized in ARL. OBJECTIVE: Characterization of the DNA copy number change (CNC) in ARL and comparison of our findings with tumoral EBV and immune status. DESIGN AND METHODS: We have studied by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), 28 ARL well characterized for histopathologic, clonality and EBV findings. RESULTS: DNA-CNC were detected in 50% of cases. Gains of chromosomal material were much more frequent than losses and involved chromosomes 9p, 11q, 12q, 17q, and 19q recurrently. DNA-CNC tended to be more frequent in EBV-positive lymphomas with latency type II/III than in EBV-positive latency I or EBV-negative lymphomas. Most chromosomal regions affected in HIV-related lymphoma were similar to those already reported in HIV-negative lymphomas. CONCLUSION: This CGH study allowed the identification of non-random chromosomal alterations in ARL. The results suggested an inverse relationship between EBV infection (latency II/III), associated with deep acquired immune suppression, and the number of chromosomal alterations which may be explained by a direct role of viral proteins in lymphomagenesis by activation of signalling pathways without needing several genomic alterations.
A novel heterozygous mutation of three consecutive nucleotides causing Apert syndrome in a Congolese family. Apert syndrome (OMIM 101200) is a rare genetic condition characterized by craniosynostosis and syndactyly of hands and feet with clinical variability. Two single nucleotides mutations in the linker region between the immunoglobulin-like domains II and IIIa of the ectodomainin the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2 gene (FGFR2, OMIM 176943) are responsible of the vast majority of cases: c.755C>G; p.Ser252Trp (65%) and c.758C>G; p.Pro253Arg (34%. Three exceptional cases carry multiple substitutions of adjacent nucleotides in the linker region.Here we present a Congolese male patient and his mother, both affected with Apert syndrome of variable severity, carrying a previously undescribed heterozygous mutation of three consecutive nucleotides (c.756_758delGCCinsCTT) in the IgII-IgIIIa linker region. This is the fourth live-born patient to carry a multiple nucleotide substitution in the linker region and is the second alternative amino acid substitutions of the Pro253. Remarkably, this novel mutation was detected in the first Central African patient ever to be tested molecularly for the Apert syndrome. To discriminate between a hitherto unreported mutation and an ethnic specific polymorphism, we tested 105 Congolese controls, and no variation was detected.
X-linked borderline mental retardation with prominent behavioral disturbance: Phenotype, genetic localization, and evidence for disturbed monoamine metabolism. We have identified a large Dutch kindred with a new form of X-linked nondysmorphic mild mental retardation. All affected males in this family show very characteristic abnormal behavior, in particular aggressive and sometimes violent behavior. Other types of impulsive behavior include arson, attempted rape, and exhibitionism. Attempted suicide has been reported in a single case. The locus for this disorder could be assigned to the Xp11-21 interval between DXS7 and DXS77 by linkage analysis using markers spanning the X chromosome. A maximal multipoint lod score of 3.69 was obtained at the monoamine oxidase type A (MAOA) locus in Xp11.23-11.4. Results of 24-h urine analysis in three affected males indicated a marked disturbance of monoamine metabolism. These data are compatible with a primary defect in the structural gene for MAOA and/or monoamine oxidase type B (MAOB). Normal platelet MAOB activity suggests that the unusual behavior pattern in this family may be caused by isolated MAOA deficiency.
Structure and transcription promoter activity of mouse flap endonuclease 1 gene: Alternative splicing and bidirectional promoter. Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) is a structure-specific nuclease involved in DNA replication and repair. The mouse Fen1 gene, which has two exons, is located immediately adjacent to the gene corresponding to full-length cDNA of Riken 1810006K21 (1810006K21Rik) in a head-to-head orientation. Transcription initiation sites of each gene are 274 bp apart in the mouse genome. The spacer sequence between the bidirectional genes contains a CpG island, but lacks the typical TATA box. In the present study, transcription of the mFen1 gene was started from two initiation sites, and the first noncoding exon was spliced to the second exon using two different splicing donor sites, producing 3 kinds of mFen1 transcripts. A 594-bp fragment between the mFen1 and 1810006K21Rik genes, which contains two conserved sequence blocks (CSB) between mouse and human sequence, functions as a bidirectional promoter. The multiple cis-elements, including an Ets-binding site and E-box in the CSB, are involved in activation or repression of transcription in both directions. Interestingly, the E-box activates mFen1 transcription and simultaneously represses promoter activity in the opposite direction. Mutation of either splicing donor site of the mFen1 gene produced limiting alternative splicing products, but did not affect luciferase activity. In contrast, the splicing-defective mutation produced by disruption of the acceptor site completely lacked luciferase activity, indicating that the splicing has a significant effect on production of luciferase protein by shortening the 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA.'
Olig1 and Sox10 interact synergistically to drive myelin basic protein transcription in oligodendrocytes. The oligodendrocyte lineage genes (Olig1/2), encoding basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, were first identified in screens for master regulators of oligodendrocyte development. OLIG1 is important for differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors into myelin-forming oligodendrocytes during development and is thought to play a crucial role in remyelination during multiple sclerosis. However, it is still unclear how OLIG1 interacts with its transcriptional cofactors and DNA targets. OLIG1 was reportedly restricted to mammals, but we demonstrate here that zebrafish and other teleosts also possess an OLIG1 homolog. In zebrafish, as in mammals, Olig1 is expressed in the oligodendrocyte lineage. Olig1 associates physically with another myelin-associated transcription factor, Sox10, and the Olig1/Sox10 complex activates mbp (myelin basic protein) transcription via conserved DNA sequence motifs in the mbp promoter region. In contrast, Olig2 does not bind to Sox10 in zebrafish, although both OLIG1 and OLIG2 bind SOX10 in mouse.
miR-124 and miR-128 differential expression in bone marrow stromal cells and spinal cord-derived neural stem cells. Background: MicroRNA (miRNA) expression in stem cells provides important clues for the molecular mechanisms of stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Bone marrow stromal cells and spinal cord-derived neural stem cells exhibit potential for neural regeneration. However, miRNA expression in these cells has been rarely reported. Objective: To explore differential expression of two nervous system-specific miRNAs, miR-124 and miR-128, in bone marrow stromal cells and spinal cord-derived neural stem cells. Design, Time and Setting: An In vitro, cell biology experiment was performed at the Department of Biotechnology, Shanxi Medical University from June 2008 to June 2009. Meterials: TaqMan miRNA assays were purchased from Applied Biosystems. Methods: Rat bone marrow stromal cells were isolated and cultured using the whole-bone marrow method, and rat spinal cord-derived neural stem cells were obtained through neurosphere formation. TaqMan miRNA assays were used to measure miR-124 and miR-128 expression in bone marrow stromal cells and spinal cord-derived neural stem cells. Main Outcome Measures: Morphology of bone marrow stromal cells and spinal cord-derived neural stem cells were observed by inverted microscopy. Expression of the neural stem cell-specific marker, nestin, the bone marrow stromal cell surface marker, CD71, and expression of miR-124 and miR-128, were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: Cultured bone marrow stromal cells displayed a short fusiform shape. Flow cytometry revealed a large number of CD71-positive cells (> 95%). Cultured spinal cord-derived neural stem cells formed nestin-positive neurospheres, and quantitative detection of miRNA demonstrated that less miR-124 and miR-128 was expressed in bone marrow stromal cells compared to spinal cord-derived neural stem cells (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Bone marrow stromal cells and spinal cord-derived neural stem cells exhibited differential expression of miR-124 and miR-128, which suggested different characteristics in miRNA expression.
MicroRNA expression pattern as an ancillary prognostic signature for radiotherapy 11 Medical and Health Sciences 1112 Oncology and Carcinogenesis. Background: In view of the limited knowledge of plasma biomarkers relating to cancer resistance to radiotherapy, we have set up screening, training and testing stages to investigate the microRNAs (miRNAs) expression profile in plasma to predict between the poor responsive and responsive groups after 6 months of radiotherapy. Methods: Plasma was collected prior to and after radiotherapy, and the microRNA profiles were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) arrays. Candidate miRNAs were validated by single qRT-PCR assays from the training and testing set. The classifier for ancillary prognosis was developed by multiple logistic regression analysis to correlate the ratios of miRNAs expression levels with clinical data. Results: We revealed that eight miRNAs expressions had significant changes after radiotherapy and the expression levels of miR-374a-5p, miR-342-5p and miR-519d-3p showed significant differences between the responsive and poor responsive groups in the pre-radiotherapy samples. The Kaplan-Meier curve analysis also showed that low miR-342-5p and miR-519d-3p expressions were associated with worse prognosis. Our results revealed two miRNA classifiers from the pre- and post-radiotherapy samples to predict radiotherapy response with area under curve values of 0.8923 and 0.9405. Conclusions: The expression levels of miR-374a-5p, miR-342-5p and miR-519d-3p in plasma are associated with radiotherapy responses. Two miRNA classifiers could be developed as a potential non-invasive ancillary tool for predicting patient response to radiotherapy.
Intracellular ca2+ increases and connexin 43 hemichannel opening are necessary but not sufficient for thy-1-induced astrocyte migration. Under pro-inflammatory conditions, astrocytes become reactive and acquire a migratory phenotype. Our results show that hemichannels formed by connexin 43 (Cx43) play an important role in Thy-1-induced astrocyte migration. The neuronal protein Thy-1 binds to αvβ3 integrin in astrocytes, thereby leading to intricate signaling pathways that include calcium (Ca2+) release from intracellular stores, opening of Cx43 hemichannels, release of ATP, activation of P2X7 receptor, and Ca2+ influx. However, because these Thy-1 effects occur exclusively in reactive astrocytes, we wondered whether by elevating calcium levels and promoting hemichannel opening we could prompt non-reactive astrocytes to respond to Thy-1. Cx43 immunoreactivity increased at juxta-membrane sites, where hemichannels (not gap junctions) participate in astrocyte polarization and migration stimulated by Thy-1. Also, intracellular Ca2+ increase, due to ionomycin treatment, induced hemichannel opening, but activated astrocyte migration only partially, and this limitation was overcome by pre-treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and Thy-1. Finally, αvβ3 integrin formed membrane clusters after TNF stimulation or overexpression of β3 integrin. We suggest that these microclusters are required for cells to respond to Thy-1 stimulation. Therefore, the large increase in intracellular Ca2+ and hemichannel opening induced by ionomycin are required, but not sufficient, to permit Thy-1-induced astrocyte migration. Thus, we suggest that proinflammatory stimuli prompt astrocytes to respond to migratory signals of neuronal cells.
Fragment-Based Discovery of an Apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) Stabilizer. Apolipoprotein E is a 299-residue lipid carrier protein produced in both the liver and the brain. The protein has three major isoforms denoted apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4 which differ at positions 112 and 158 and which occur at different frequencies in the human population. Genome-wide association studies indicate that the possession of two apoE4 alleles is a strong genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). In an attempt to identify a small molecule stabilizer of apoE4 function that may have utility as a therapy for Alzheimer's disease, we carried out an NMR-based fragment screen on the N-terminal domain of apoE4 and identified a benzyl amidine based fragment binder. In addition to NMR, binding was characterized using various other biophysical techniques, and a crystal structure of the bound core was obtained. Core elaboration ultimately yielded a compound that showed activity in an IL-6 and IL-8 cytokine release assay
Serum osteoprotegerin (OPG) and the A163G polymorphism in the OPG promoter region are related to peripheral measures of bone mass and fracture odds ratios. The purpose of this study is to investigate the association of serum osteoprotegerin (OPG) and the A163G polymorphism in the OPG promoter with peripheral measures of bone mass and with odds ratios for wrist and hip fracture in a case-control study of postmenopausal Danish women. The study included 66 women with lower forearm fracture, 41 women with hip fracture, and 206 age-matched controls. All had broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) and speed of sound (SOS) measured at the heel as well as bone mineral density (BMD) measured by DXA at the distal forearm. S-OPG was measured by ELISA. The A163G genotypes were determined by PCR-RFLP analysis. S-OPG levels correlated positively with age (r = 0.45; P < 0.0001) and negatively with distal forearm BMD (r = -0.31; P < 0.0001), heel BUA (r = -0.23; P < 0.0001), and heel SOS (r = -0.22; P < 0.0001). Comparing the highest quartile of S-OPG to the lowest, the odds ratio for osteoporotic fracture was 2.5 (95% CI, 1.3-4.7; P = 0.006). The G allele of the A163G was associated with significantly lower t-scores of both lower forearm BMD, heel BUA, and heel SOS as well as being significantly more frequent in the fracture patients compared to the controls. Patients with a combination of the highest quartile of S-OPG and presence of the G allele (n = 23) had a significantly elevated fracture odds ratio, 4.0 (95% CI, 1.7-9.9). A significant negative association between S-OPG with peripheral measures of bone mass and with increased fracture odds ratios was found. Furthermore, the A163G mutation in the OPG promoter had a significant influence on bone mass and fracture status independently of S-OPG level.
The structure, function, and expression of interleukin-2 receptors on normal and malignant lymphocytes. Antigen or mitogen-induced activation of resting T cells induces the synthesis of interleukin-2 (IL-2) as well as the expression of specific cell surface receptors for this lymphokine. Failure of the production of either IL-2 or its receptor results in a failure of the T-cell immune response. The receptor is composed of a 33,000-dalton (251-amino acid) peptide precursor that is post-translationally glycosylated into the mature 55,000-dalton form. In contrast to resting T cells, human T-cell lymphotrophic virus I (HTLV-I)-associated adult T-cell leukemia cells constitutively express large numbers of IL-2 receptors. Because IL-2 receptors are present on the malignant T cells but not on normal resting cells, clinical trials have been initiated in which patients with adult T-cell leukemia are treated with a monoclonal antibody that binds to the IL-2 receptor.
CYP3A7*1C allele: linking premenopausal oestrone and progesterone levels with risk of hormone receptor-positive breast cancers. Background: Epidemiological studies provide strong evidence for a role of endogenous sex hormones in the aetiology of breast cancer. The aim of this analysis was to identify genetic variants that are associated with urinary sex-hormone levels and breast cancer risk. Methods: We carried out a genome-wide association study of urinary oestrone-3-glucuronide and pregnanediol-3-glucuronide levels in 560 premenopausal women, with additional analysis of progesterone levels in 298 premenopausal women. To test for the association with breast cancer risk, we carried out follow-up genotyping in 90,916 cases and 89,893 controls from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. All women were of European ancestry. Results: For pregnanediol-3-glucuronide, there were no genome-wide significant associations; for oestrone-3-glucuronide, we identified a single peak mapping to the CYP3A locus, annotated by rs45446698. The minor rs45446698-C allele was associated with lower oestrone-3-glucuronide (−49.2%, 95% CI −56.1% to −41.1%, P = 3.1 × 10–18); in follow-up analyses, rs45446698-C was also associated with lower progesterone (−26.7%, 95% CI −39.4% to −11.6%, P = 0.001) and reduced risk of oestrogen and progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer (OR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.82–0.91, P = 6.9 × 10–8). Conclusions: The CYP3A7*1C allele is associated with reduced risk of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer possibly mediated via an effect on the metabolism of endogenous sex hormones in premenopausal women.
Genetics of Malaria Inflammatory Responses: A Pathogenesis Perspective. Despite significant progress in combating malaria in recent years the burden of severe disease and death due to Plasmodium infections remains a global public health concern. Only a fraction of infected people develops severe clinical syndromes motivating a longstanding search for genetic determinants of malaria severity. Strong genetic effects have been repeatedly ascribed to mutations and allelic variants of proteins expressed in red blood cells but the role of inflammatory response genes in disease pathogenesis has been difficult to discern. We revisited genetic evidence provided by inflammatory response genes that have been repeatedly associated to malaria, namely TNF, NOS2, IFNAR1, HMOX1, TLRs, CD36, and CD40LG. This highlighted specific genetic variants having opposing roles in the development of distinct malaria clinical outcomes and unveiled diverse levels of genetic heterogeneity that shaped the complex association landscape of inflammatory response genes with malaria. However, scrutinizing genetic effects of individual variants corroborates a pathogenesis model where pro-inflammatory genetic variants acting in early infection stages contribute to resolve infection but at later stages confer increased vulnerability to severe organ dysfunction driven by tissue inflammation. Human genetics studies are an invaluable tool to find genes and molecular pathways involved in the inflammatory response to malaria but their precise roles in disease pathogenesis are still unexploited. Genome editing in malaria experimental models and novel genotyping-by-sequencing techniques are promising approaches to delineate the relevance of inflammatory response gene variants in the natural history of infection thereby will offer new rational angles on adjuvant therapeutics for prevention and clinical management of severe malaria.
Comprehensive Analyses of the Expression, Genetic Alteration, Prognosis Significance, and Interaction Networks of m6A Regulators Across Human Cancers. Accumulating lines of evidence indicate that the deregulation of m6A is involved in various cancer types. The m6A RNA methylation is modulated by m6A methyltransferases, demethylases, and reader proteins. Although the aberrant expression of m6A RNA methylation contributes to the development and progression of multiple cancer types, the roles of m6A regulators across numerous types of cancers remain largely unknown. Here, we comprehensively investigated the expression, genetic alteration, and prognosis significance of 20 commonly studied m6A regulators across diverse cancer types using TCGA datasets via bioinformatic analyses. The results revealed that the m6A regulators exhibited widespread dysregulation, genetic alteration, and the modulation of oncogenic pathways across TCGA cancer types. In addition, most of the m6A regulators were closely relevant with significant prognosis in many cancer types. Furthermore, we also constructed the protein–protein interacting network of the 20 m6A regulators, and a more complex interacting regulatory network including m6A regulators and their corresponding interacting factors. Besides, the networks between m6A regulators and their upstream regulators such as miRNAs or transcriptional factors were further constructed in this study. Finally, the possible chemicals targeting each m6A regulator were obtained by bioinformatics analysis and the m6A regulators–potential drugs network was further constructed. Taken together, the comprehensive analyses of m6A regulators might provide novel insights into the m6A regulators’ roles across cancer types and shed light on their potential molecular mechanisms as well as help develop new therapy approaches for cancers
Understanding the functional role of genistein in the bone differentiation in mouse osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 by RNA-seq analysis. Genistein, a phyto-estrogen, can potentially replace endogenous estrogens in postmenopausal women, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. To obtain insight into the effect of genistein on bone differentiation, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis was used to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in genistein-treated vs. untreated MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblastic cells. Osteoblastic cell differentiation was monitored by measuring osteoblast differentiation factors (ALP production, bone mineralization, and expression of osteoblast differentiation markers). From RNA-seq analysis, a total of 132 DEGs (including 52 up-regulated and 80 down-regulated genes) were identified in genistein-treated cells (FDR q-value < 0.05 and fold change > 1.5). KEGG pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses were performed to estimate the biological functions of DEGs and demonstrated that these DEGs were highly enriched in functions related to chemotactic cytokines. The functional relevance of DEGs to genistein-induced osteoblastic cell differentiation was further evaluated by siRNA-mediated knockdown in MC3T3-E1 cells. These siRNA knockdown experiments (of the DEGs validated by real-time qPCR) demonstrated that two up-regulated genes (Ereg and Efcab2) enhance osteoblastic cell differentiation, while three down-regulated genes (Hrc, Gli, and Ifitm5) suppress the differentiation. These results imply their major functional roles in bone differentiation regulated by genistein.
Construction of stable focal adhesion kinase knockdown cell line and preliminary study of its properties. Malignant melanoma still remains to be a serious health threat. Overexpression of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in melanoma has suggested that FAK could be a promising target for therapeutic intervention. To further investigate the function of FAK in melanoma, FAK expression was down-regulated by stable transfection of plasmid harboring FAK small interfering RNA (siRNA) into melanoma cell line. Two stable cell lines, F10-siFAK and F10-control, have been constructed and screened. Compared with the F10-control, both the mRNA and protein levels of FAK decreased significantly, and the cell cycle of F10-siFAK was arrested at G1 phase. Furthermore, the tumor growth rate of F10-siFAK cells was notably slower than that of F10-control in in vivo tumor models. These results show that FAK is an important regulatory gene in melanoma. The stable FAK-knockdown melanoma cell line is an useful tool for further investigation of FAK's function in the progression of melanoma, and also an effective means of drug screening for anti-melanoma therapeutics.
Anti-Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein Encephalomyelitis and Extensive Longitudinal Transverse Myelitis Associated with Compound Heterozygous NLRP3 Missense Mutations in a Young Child. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in association with extensive longitudinal transverse myelitis is reported in a young child with positive anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody with heterozygous NLRP3 missense mutations; p.(Arg488Lys) and p.(Ser159Ile). This case may well present an exceptional coincidence, but may describe a yet unrecognized feature of the spectrum of childhood onset cryopyrinopathies that contribute to the understanding of the genetic basis for anti-MOG antibody positive encephalomyelitis. Based on this observation, a larger scale study investigating the role of NLRP3 and other inflammasomes in this entity would provide important pathophysiological insights and potentially novel avenues for treatment.
p53 alteration and chromosomal instability in prostatic high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and concurrent carcinoma: Analysis by immunohistochemistry, interphase in situ hybridization, and sequencing of laser-captured microdissected specimens. p53 mutation has been shown to be associated with chromosomal instability (CI) in many human dysplastic and neoplastic lesions. However, the precise role of p53 in the pathogenesis of prostate carcinoma (Pca) is unknown. Topographic analysis of p53 alteration using immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on 35 archived prostatectomy specimens containing Pca foci; high-grade prostrate intraepithelial neoplasia (HPIN) foci intermingled with cancer (HPINI) and situated away (HPINA). Specimens from 2 patients were topographically genotyped using laser capture microdissection, PCR amplification, and direct sequencing of p53 exons 5-9. CI was evaluated in the same tissue foci by interphase in situ hybridization (IFISH) using centromere probes for chromosomes 7, 8, and Y. p53 immunoreactivity was found in 20%, 17%, 0, and 0 in Pca, HPINI, HPINA, and benign epithelium, respectively. p53 molecular analysis in the specimens examined confirmed the IHC findings. IFISH revealed numerical chromosomal alterations in keeping with CI in 71% and 25% of p53+ and p53- Pca, respectively (P = .1), 67% and 0 of p53+ and p53HPIN, respectively (P < .02), and in 27% and 0 of HPINI and HPINA, respectively. We concluded that p53 mutation is an early change in at least a subset of Pca. HPINI foci tend to have higher overall p53 immunoreactivity and CI than HPINA. The presence of p53 mutation in HPIN was associated with the presence of CI as determined by IFISH. Our study also provided additional evidence in support of the concept that HPIN might be the earliest precursor of cancer. Furthermore, our studies identify genomic similarities in HPINI and Pca, implying that carcinoma may arise from progression of certain HPIN foci that most likely harbor p53 mutation and/or more CI.
Identification of ataxia telangiectasia heterozygotes by flow cytometric analysis of X-ray damage. Flow cytometry was used to identify heterozygotes for the autosomal recessive DNA-repair deficiency disease ataxia telangiectasia (AT). Confluent G0/G1 fibroblasts from 4 homozygotes (at/at), 5 obligate heterozygotes (at/+) and 7 presumed normal controls (+/+) were X-irradiated with 200 Rad and subcultured immediately in medium containing 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Cells were harvested 72 h later and stained with fluoresceinated anti-BrdU antibody to identify cells that had entered S phase. They were counterstained with propidium iodide to measure total DNA content. On the basis of relative release from G0/G1 the at/+ strains as a group (33 ± 3% release) were distinguished from both the presumed +/+ strains (60 ± 3%), although the individual values for some strains did show overlap between genotypes. When 10 cell strains were coded and analyzed in 'blind' experiments, all 4 heterozygotes were correctly assigned, although one poorly growing presumed normal line was incorrectly assigned as a heterozygote. By a similar assay in which exponentially growing cultures were pulsed briefly with BrdU 8 h after irradiation with 400 Rad and then harvested immediately, presumed +/+ cells as a group could be distinguished from at/at cells but not from at/- cells. This combination of assays assits in the identification of all 3 AT genotypes. This should be of both basic and diagnostic use, particularly in families known to segregate AT.
Roles of Met-34, Cys-64, and Arg-75 in the assembly of human connexin 26: Implication for key amino acid residues for channel formation and function. Connexins form a family of membrane proteins that assemble into communication channels and directly connect the cytoplasms of adjoining cells. Malfunctioning of connexin channels often cause disease, such as the mutations M34T and R75W in human connexin 26, which are associated with hereditary deafness. Another residue known to be essential for normal channel activity in the connexin is Cys-64. To obtain structural and functional insights of connexin 26, we studied the roles of these three residues by expressing mutant connexins in insect Sf9 and HeLa cells. The M34T and M34A mutants both formed gap junction plaques, but dye transfer assays showed that the M34A mutant had a significantly reduced permeability, suggesting that for proper channel function a side chain of adequate size is required at this position. We propose that Met-34 is located in the innermost helix of the channel, where it ensures a fully open channel structure via interactions with other transmembrane helices. Gap junction channels formed by the R75W and R75D mutants dissociated upon solubilization in dodecyl maltoside, whereas the R75A mutant remained hexameric. All gap junctions formed by Arg-75 mutants also showed only negligible activity in dye transfer experiments. These results suggest that residue Arg-75 plays a role in subunit interactions needed to retain a functional and stable connexin hexamer. The C64S mutant was suggested to be defective in oligomerization and/or protein folding even in the presence of wild-type connexin.
LncRNA-AK017233 expression is down-regulated in urethane-induced mouse lung tumors. OBJECTIVE: To explore the dynamic change of IncRNA expression during lung carcinogenesis induced by urethane. METHODS: A total of 40 BALB/c mice received weekly ip injection of urethane 1 g·kg-1 for four continuous weeks, mice were euthanized at 12th week or 24th week after the first urethane treatment, respectively. The RNA of lung tissues were isolated and used for microarray analysis. Based on the results of the microarray we selected IncRNA-AK017233 for additional qPCR analysis in individual mouse. RESULTS: The incidence of lung cancer were 85% and 100% at 12th week and 24th week after the first administration of urethane, respectively. The multiplicity and diameter of lung tumors in 24 weeks treated group were statistically significant from those in 12 weeks treated group (P<0.01), and pathological analysis showed that tumors were classifiable as moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Total of 26 Down-regulated IncRNAs in which IncRNA-AK017233 stand for the most down-regulated IncRNA were identified by microcarray analysis. qPCR detected that the IncRNA-AK017233 was significantly altered by 0.33 times in lung tumors of urethane treated group at 12th week, compared to parallel lung tissues in urethane treated group at 12th week. AK017233 expression of urethane treated group was significantly reduced by 0.22 times at 24th week, compared to parallel lung tissues in urethane treated group at 24th week. CONCLUSION: LncRNA-AK017233 was consistently down-regulated during urethane induced lung carcinogenesis.
The major dermatomyositis‐specific mi‐2 autoantigen is a presumed helicase involved in transcriptional activation. Objective. To characterize the complementary DNA (cDNA) and protein sequences of autoantigens recognized by anti–Mi‐2 antibodies, using recombinant Mi‐2 proteins for improved autoantibody detection. Methods. A cDNA expression library was immunoscreened, and cDNA isolation, alignment, and sequence analysis were performed. Northern blotting and in situ hybridization techniques were used. A recombinant protein (rMi‐2) was synthesized. Immunoprecipitation of 35S‐methionine–labeled HEp‐2 cell proteins and immunoblotting of rMi‐2 and natural nuclear proteins were performed. Immunofluorescence studies were done with anti–Mi‐2 positive sera of dermatomyositis (DM) patients, and with human or rabbit antibodies specific for rMi‐2. Antibody screening of systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, DM, and antinuclear antibody–positive human sera was performed using an rMi‐2 protein enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results. A major antigen recognized by anti–Mi‐2 positive sera of DM patients was found to constitute a 218‐kd nuclear protein (218‐kd Mi‐2) encoded on chromosome 12 and to belong to the SNF2/RAD 54 helicase family. Human and rabbit antibodies that were affinity purified using the recombinant protein reacted with and precipitated a nuclear protein of similar size, which was also recognized by anti–Mi‐2 sera. Anti–218‐kd Mi‐2 antibodies detected by rMi‐2 protein ELISA seemed to be mainly restricted to sera from patients with DM. Conclusion. The molecular characterization of the 218‐kd Mi‐2 antigen may contribute to our understanding of autoimmune phenomena in DM. The use of immunoreactive recombinant proteins allows structural and functional studies of the helicase and the development of sensitive and accurate antibody screening tests.
Long term endocrine regulation of nucleoside transporters in rat intestinal epithelial cells. We studied the regulation of nucleoside transporters in intestinal epithelial cells upon exposure to either differentiating or proliferative agents. Rat intestinal epithelial cells (line IEC-6) were incubated in the presence of differentiating (glucocorticoids) or proliferative (EGF and TGF-α) agents. Nucleoside uptake rates and nucleoside transporter protein and mRNA levels were assessed. The signal transduction pathways used by the proliferative stimuli were analyzed. We found that glucocorticoids induce an increase in sodium-dependent, concentrative nucleoside transport rates and in protein and mRNA levels of both rCNT2 and rCNT1, with negligible effects on the equilibrative transporters. EGF and TGF-α induce an increase in the equilibrative transport rate, mostly accounted for by an increase in rENT1 activity and mRNA levels, rENT2 mRNA levels remaining unaltered. This effect is mimicked by another proliferative stimulus that functions as an in vitro model of epithelial wounding. Here, rENT1 activity and mRNA levels are also increased, although the signal transduction pathways used by the two stimuli are different. We concluded that differentiation of rat intestinal epithelial cells is accompanied by increased mature enterocyte features, such as concentrative nucleoside transport (located at the brush border membrane of the enterocyte), thus preparing the cell for its ultimate absorptive function. A proliferative stimulus induces the equilibrative nucleoside activities (mostly through ENT1) known to be located at the basolateral membrane, allowing the uptake of nucleosides from the bloodstream for the increased demands of the proliferating cell.
Decrease of PDSS2 expression, a novel tumor suppressor, in non-small cell lung cancer. Background: Prenyl diphosphate synthase subunit 2 (PDSS2) gene has recently been reported as a potential tumor suppressor. The association of PDSS2 and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been known. Methods: To investigate its association with NSCLC, we examined the expression level of PDSS2 in 28 paired clinical samples of non-small cell lung cancer tissues and surrounding normal tissues. Results: PDSS2 was constitutionally expressed in normal lung tissues regardless of sex, race and smoking history. An overall decreased PDSS2 expression was found in the tumor tissues compared to surrounding normal tissues. Decrease in PDSS2 expression was more severe in poorly and poor-to-moderately differentiated lung cancers, while the decrease was not significant in moderately to well-differentiated tumors. Moreover, the expression of PDSS2 decreased more in higher pathological stage, and in patients with lymph node metastasis. The decrease in PDSS2 expression in tumor tissues was not related to sex or histological type of NSCLC, but was related to smoking history. No correlation has been found between PDSS2 and the clinical factors of EGRF, Ki-67 and p53. Conclusion: Taken together, decreased expression of PDSS2 in NSCLC was evident. This is an initial report for the expression of PDSS2 in relation to different factors in lung cancer. Loss of PDSS2 could serve as a potential biomarker in NSCLC development. The role of PDSS2 as a tumor suppressor, and the mechanism of its potential anti-tumor action in NSCLC warrant further investigation.
Ischaemia/reperfusion induced cardiac stem cell homing to the injured myocardium by stimulating stem cell factor expression via NF-κB pathway. Ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) is a major cause of heart failure. Recently cardiac stem cells (CSCs) were proposed as the most appropriate cell type for heart disease therapy. However, it is still unclear whether I/R can stimulate the CSCs homing to the injured myocardium. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a 30-min ischaemia followed by reperfusion of different intervals. RT-PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to detect stem cell factor (SCF) expression at mRNA and protein levels respectively. Activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. To assess the homing of CSCs in vivo, BrdU-labelled CSCs were injected into AV-groove before induction of ischaemia and examined by immunofluorescent staining in the injured myocardium after I/R. From day 3 to day 6 after reperfusion, the accumulation of CSCs was significantly elevated in the injured area, which was matched with the increased SCF expression during I/R. Pretreatment of rats with NF-κB inhibitor, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) not only suppressed NF-κB activation induced by I/R but also attenuated SCF expression. Further analysis revealed that I/R induced phosphorylation of IκBα after 15 min of reperfusion, and the raised phosphor-IκBα returned to the basal level at 2 h of reperfusion. In simulated I/R(SI/R) in vitro, it enhanced NF-κB activation and SCF expression in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, which was markedly inhibited by NF-κB decoy oligodeoxynucleotide or NAC. Taken together, our results demonstrated that I/R induced CSCs homing to the injured myocardium by stimulating myocardial SCF expression via activation of NF-κB.
Differential nonsense mediated decay of mutated mRNAs in mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancers. The nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) system normally targets mRNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs) for rapid degradation. We investigated for a putative role of NMD in cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI-H cancers), because numerous mutant mRNAs containing PTC are generated in these tumors as a consequence of their mismatch repair deficiency. Using a quantitative RT-PCR approach in a large series of colorectal cancer cell lines, we demonstrate a significantly increased rate of degradation of mutant mRNAs containing a PTC compared with wild-type. A specific siRNA strategy was used to inhibit RENT-1 and/ or RENT-2 activity, two major genes in the NMD system. This allowed us to show that increased degradation of PTC-containing mRNAs in MSI-H tumors was partly dependent upon NMD activity. The efficiency of NMD for the degradation of mutant mRNAs from target genes was highly variable in these cancers. NMD degraded some of them (TGFβRII, MSH3, GRK4), although allowing the persistent expression of others (BAX, TCF-4). This is of particular interest within the context of a proposed conservation of biological activity for the corresponding mutated proteins. We thus propose that NMD might play an important role in the selection of target gene mutations with a functional role in MSI-H carcinogenesis.
Complete transformation by adenovirus 2 requires both E1A proteins. Rodent cells transformed by adenovirus 2 (Ad2) express two highly related viral proteins of 289 and 243 amino acids encoded in early region 1A (E1A). Transformation studies were performed with adenovirus mutants that express only one or the other E1A protein. We found that the 289 amino acid protein, which has transcription inducing activity, and the 243 amino acid protein, which has little if any of this activity, were both required to produce the fully transformed phenotype. Expression of either E1A protein induced a partially transformed phenotype. The 243 amino acid protein was particularly important for anchorage independent growth. As found in previous studies with several other E1A mutants, the process of transformation by the mutant that expresses the 243 amino acid protein only was cold-sensitive. While the 289 amino acid protein is the only E1A protein required for efficient viral replication under standard cell culture conditions, the 243 amino acid protein in addition to the 289 amino acid protein was found to be required for efficient viral replication in growth-arrested human cells.
SIRT1 suppresses cellular accumulation of β-TrCP E3 ligase via protein degradation. β-Transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP), an E3 ligase, promotes the degradation of substrate proteins in response to various stimuli. Even though several β-TrCP substrates have been identified to date, limited information of its upstream regulators is available. Here, we showed that SIRT1 suppresses β-TrCP protein synthesis via post-translational degradation. SIRT1 depletion led to a significant increase in the β-TrCP accumulation without affecting the mRNA level. Consistently, β-TrCP protein accumulation induced by resveratrol was further enhanced upon SIRT1 depletion. Rescue of SIRT1 reversed the effect of resveratrol, leading to reduced β-TrCP protein levels. Proteasomal inhibition led to recovery of β-TrCP in cells with SIRT1 overexpression. Notably, the recovered β-TrCP colocalized mostly with SIRT1. Thus, SIRT1 acts as a negative regulator of β-TrCP synthesis via promoting protein degradation.
Mast cell chymase affects the functional properties of primary human airway fibroblasts: Implications for asthma. Background: Mast cells (MCs) have a profound impact on allergic asthma. Under such conditions, MCs undergo degranulation, resulting in the release of exceptionally large amounts of MC-restricted proteases. However, the role of these proteases in asthma is only partially understood. Objectives: We sought to test our hypothesis that MC proteases can influence the functionality of human lung fibroblasts (HLFs). Methods: Primary HLFs were treated with MC chymase or tryptase, followed by assessment of parameters related to fibroblast function. Results: HLFs underwent major morphologic changes in response to chymase, showing signs of cellular contraction, but were refractory to tryptase. However, no effects of chymase on HLF viability or proliferation were seen. Chymase, but not tryptase, had a major impact on the output of extracellular matrix–associated compounds from the HLFs, including degradation of fibronectin and collagen-1, and activation of pro–matrix metalloprotease 2. Further, chymase induced the release of various chemotactic factors from HLFs. In line with this, conditioned medium from chymase-treated HLFs showed chemotactic activity on neutrophils. Transcriptome analysis revealed that chymase induced a proinflammatory gene transcription profile in HLFs, whereas tryptase had minimal effects. Conclusions: Chymase, but not tryptase, has a major impact on the phenotype of primary airway fibroblasts by modifying their output of extracellular matrix components and by inducing a proinflammatory phenotype.
Cadherin junctions in mammary tumors. Cadherins are the transmembrane component of adherens junctions found between interacting cells in tissues. The cadherins bind cells to one another in a specific manner and link to the actin cytoskeleton through intracellular catenins. In addition to promoting strong cell-cell adhesion, cadherins appear to initiate and modify intracellular signaling pathways. The loss of E-cadherin function in epithelial cells is thought to be an important step in tumorigenesis. Moreover, anomalous expression of inappropriate cadherins in epithelial cells alters their behavior and may contribute to the tumorigenic phenotype. For breast cancer the decreased expression of E-cadherin alone may have limited value as a prognostic indicator; however, examining the repertoire of cadherins and catenins expressed by tumors may provide useful prognostic information.
Plasma miR-155, mir-203, and miR-205 are biomarkers for monitoring of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) affect the skin and tend to transform and spread. CTCL involves primarily the Mycosis fungoides (MF) and more aggressive Sezary syndrome (SS). Oncogenic microRNAs (miRs) are stable epigenetic inhibitors often deregulated in the tumour and detectable as biomarkers in non-cellular fractions of peripheral blood. The tumour-specific expression of miR-155, miR-203, and miR-205 was shown to correctly diagnose CTCL. We herein asked whether these microRNAs can be used as plasma biomarkers for clinical CTCL monitoring. Patients with CTCL (n = 10) and controls with non-malignant conditions (n = 11) repeatedly donated plasma samples every ca. five months. MicroRNAs were detected in the plasma samples by specifically-primed RT-PCR followed by multivariate analyses of the miR expression dynamics. We herein established the plasma miR-classifier for detecting CTCL based on the miR-155 upregulation and miR-203/miR-205 downregulation with 100% specificity and 94% sensitivity. The 3-miR-score in the consecutive samples coincided with the clinical outcome of MF and SS patients such as the therapy response or changes in the clinical stage or tumor size. Quantitation of the selected microRNAs in plasma is a specific and straightforward approach for evaluating CTCL outcome representing, thus, a valuable tool for CTCL diagnostics and therapy response monitoring.
Inhibitor of growth tumor suppressors in cancer progression. The inhibitor of growth (ING) family of tumor suppressors has five members and is implicated in the control of apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, and cancer progression. However, little is known about ING activity in the regulation of cancer progression. ING members and splice variants seem to behave differently with respect to cancer invasion and metastasis. Interaction with histone trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), p53, and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) are potential mechanisms by which ING members exert effects on invasion and metastasis. Subcellular mislocalization, rapid protein degradation, and to a lesser extent ING gene mutation are among the mechanisms responsible for inappropriate ING levels in cancer cells. The aim of this review is to summarize the different roles of ING family tumor suppressors in cancer progression and the molecular mechanisms involved.
Nucleotide Sequence of the Simian Virus 40 Hind II + III Restriction Fragment J and the Total Amino Acid Sequence of the Major Structural Protein VP1. The HindII + III restriction fragment J (Hind‐J) represents 4.58% of the simian virus 40 genome. The information present in Hind‐J is expressed as part of the major, late 16‐S messenger RNA, which codes for the structural protein VP1. The nucleotide sequence of the 240‐base‐pairs‐long Hind fragment J has been determined by analysis of each oligonucleotide from both strands resulting from T1 or pancreatic RNase digestion of RNA transcribed from the DNA and from RNase digestion of ribo‐substituted DNA. Large oligonucleotide blocks which could be constructed mainly on the basis of complementarity were subsequently ordered by partial chemical degradation of terminally labeled DNA. This direct DNA sequencing approach also completely confirmed the results obtained by both aforementioned RNase degradation methods. In the strand with the same polarity as the late mRNA, triplets corresponding to termination codons are present in two of the three reading frames. The one open reading frame connects in phase with the open reading frame of the neighboring HindII + III fragments K, F and G, which have been published previously and which together with Hind‐J span the total VP1 gene. Some features of the primary nucleotide sequence of this VP1 gene and the derived VP1 amino acid sequence are discussed.
A small molecule NRF2 activator BC-1901S ameliorates inflammation through DCAF1/NRF2 axis. NRF2 is a master regulator of cellular anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory responses, and strategies to augment NRF2-dependent responses may beneficial in many diseases. Basal NRF2 protein level is constrained by constitutive KEAP1-mediated degradation, but in the presence of electrophiles, NRF2 ubiquitination is inhibited. Impeded NRF2 degradation increases NRF2 protein, resulting in up-regulation of anti-oxidant gene transcription, and decreased inflammation. KEAP1-independent mechanisms regulating NRF2 stability have also been reported. Here we employed an HTS approach and identified a small molecule, BC-1901S, that stabilized NRF2 and increased its activity. BC-1901S activated NRF2 by inhibiting NRF2 ubiquitination in a KEAP1-independent manner. It further increased NRF2-dependent anti-oxidant gene transcription, and exhibited anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo. Further, we identified a new NRF2-interacting partner, DDB1 and CUL4 Associated Factor 1 (DCAF1), an E3 ligase that targeted NRF2 for proteasomal degradation. Mechanistically, BC-1901S directly bound to DCAF1 and disrupted NRF2/DCAF1 interaction, thus activating NRF2. These findings provide new insights in NRF2 biology and NRF2 based anti-inflammatory therapy.
Recent studies of the human chromosome 9p21 locus, which is associated with atherosclerosis in human populations. The chromosome 9p21 (Chr9p21) locus was discovered in 2007 by independent genome-wide association studies for coronary artery disease. Since then, the locus has been replicated numerous times and can be considered the most robust genetic marker of coronary artery disease today. Subsequent work has shown associations of Chr9p21 with a number of additional cardiovascular disease traits, such as carotid artery plaque, stroke, aneurysms, peripheral artery disease, heart failure, and cardiovascular mortality, suggesting a more general role in vascular pathology. Importantly, Chr9p21 lacks associations with common cardiovascular risk factors, such as lipids and hypertension, indicating that the locus exerts its effect through a completely novel mechanism. One of the challenges is that the core haplotype block at Chr9p21 resides in a region of the genome devoid of protein-coding genes. Recent progress has been made by functional studies focusing on differential expression of antisense noncoding RNA in the INK4 locus (ANRIL), which is transcribed from the Chr9p21 locus, as well as neighboring protein-coding genes at the INK4/ARF locus. The emerging concept suggests that ANRIL might constitute a regulator of epigenetic modification and thus modulate cardiovascular risk. Here, we review the current clinical, mechanistic, and diagnostic implications of the Chr9p21 locus in cardiovascular disease.
Research progress of DNA methylation of microRNA in tumors. To review the recent progresses about microRNA (miRNA) regulated by DNA methylation in tumorsat home and abroad. The literatures with "miRNA, regulated by DNA methylation and tumors" as key words were retrieved in PubMed and CNKI from 2004-04 to 2012-05.Total 401 English papers and 40 Chinese papers were obtained. The selection criteria: 1) the bionomics of miRNA; 2) the mechanism of DNA methylation and its relationship with tumors; 3) DNA methylation of miRNA in kinds of tumors. According to the critenia, 27 papers were involved. miRNA can act as oncogene or antioncogene through DNA methylation in tumors. Totally 20% of miRNA regulated by DNA metylation is with CpG Island inside in 5kb region, so DNA methylation of miRNA is closely related with CpG Island. miR-34, miR-124, miR-9 and miR-127 are frequently methylated in kinds of tumors, most of which play roles in tumor progression by targeting oncogenes or antioncogenes. miRNA regulated by DNA methylation widely exists in human tumors, and can be used in tumor early diagnosis, treatment, metastasis and prognosis.
DNA replication in mammalian cells after the action of factors of a physical, chemical or biological nature. V. The structural reorganization of replicating DNA in HeLa cells after incubation with 5-fluorodeoxyuridine. A study was made of sedimentation properties of the nucleoid (chromatin) of HeLa cells with radio- and thermostable mode of DNA synthesis induced by 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR). After the incubation of HeLa cells with FUdR (10(-6) M, 6 h or 24 h) the rate of nucleoid sedimentation was shown to rise by 40 and 25%, respectively. Maximum relaxation of the nucleoid was observed under 5 mg/ml ethidium bromide concentration in sucrose gradients. After the incubation with FUdR the nucleoid relaxes to a lesser extent, and after irradiation its response to ethidium bromide in various concentrations was similar to that of intact nucleoid, and by this property the "FUdR nucleoid" differs essentially from the irradiated "normal nucleoid". A model of chromatin structure of cells exposed to FUdR is proposed, based on the transformation of large domains in small ones, for the explanation of radioresistant DNA synthesis.
Crosstalk between ERK2 and RXR regulates nuclear import of transcription factor NGFI-B. Transcription factor NGFI-B initiates apoptosis when allowed to translocate to mitochondria. Retinoid-X receptor (RXR), another member of the nuclear receptor family, regulates NGFI-B signaling through heterodimerization and nuclear export. Growth factor EGF activates ERK2, which phosphorylates NGFI-B and determines if NGFI-B is allowed to translocate to mitochondria. In the present study, EGF treatment resulted in an increased nuclear import of NGFI-B. Likewise, active ERK2 resulted in a preferential nuclear localization of NGFI-B. When coexpressed with RXR the nuclear import and nuclear localization induced by active ERK2 were strongly reduced. In the presence of its ligand 9-cis-retinoic acid, RXR no longer inhibited ERK2-induced nuclear import. Thus, RXR serves a permissive role for ERK2-mediated nuclear accumulation of NGFI-B. This finding represents a novel crosstalk between ERK2 and RXR signaling pathways, and explains how two independent inhibitors of apoptosis (EGF and 9-cis-retinoic acid) may cooperate to regulate nuclear targeting of apoptosis inducer NGFI-B.
NCAM(CD56) and RUNX1(AML1) are up-regulated in human ischemic cardiomyopathy and a rat model of chronic cardiac ischemia. Chronic myocardial ischemia is the leading cause of impaired myocardial contractility and heart failure. To identify differentially expressed genes in human ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), we constructed a subtracted cDNA library using specimens of ICM compared to normal human heart. Among 100 randomly sequenced clones, seven sequences represented recently identified candidate genes for differential expression in cardiac hypertrophy. A further clone without a known hypertrophy-association coded for the adhesion molecule NCAM(CD56). RNase protection assay, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting revealed strong overexpression of NCAM(CD56) in all hearts with ICM (n = 14) compared to normal hearts (n = 8), whereas in congestive cardiomyopathy (CCM) (n = 8), hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (n = 2), myocarditis (n = 4), and sarcoidosis (n = 2), at most slight overexpression of NCAM(CD56) was observed. NCAM(CD56) overexpression abnormally involved the whole cell membrane and the cytoplasma of cardiomyocytes only inside and adjacent to ischemia-induced cardiac scars. Normal or hypertrophic fibers at a distance from ischemic scars were devoid of NCAM overexpression. Identical alterations were observed in an experimental rat ICM model, but not in normal nor in spontaneously hypertensive rat hearts. In search of NCAM(CD56)-related transcription factors we found RUNX1(AML1) up-regulation in ICM and detected RUNX1(AML1) binding within the NCAM(CD56) promoter by electromobility shift assay. We concluded that strong overexpression of NCAM(CD56) and RUNX1(AML1) is a constant and characteristic feature of cardiomyocytes within or adjacent to scars in ICM.
A microRNA expression signature characterizing the properties of tumor-initiating cells for breast cancer. microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in controlling tumor behaviors either as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. To elucidate the role of miRNAs in the regulation of tumor initiation, we delineated the microRNA expression signature characterizing the properties of tumor-initiating cells for breast cancer. A group of miRNAs were differentially expressed in MDA-MB-231 and SUM1315 cells (with a high proportion of breast cancer tumor-initiating cells, CD44 +CD24 -/low subpopulation) compared to MCF-7 cells (only a small proportion of CD44 +CD24 -/low cells). Among the differentially expressed miRNAs common to MDA-MB-231 and SUM1315, approximately 46% of them are suggested to regulate the 'stemness' of stem cells or progenitor cells. Taken together, these findings suggested that miRNAs contribute to the maintenance of tumor-initiating properties and indicate the potential value of the miRNA expression signature in characterizing or predicting the features (including metastasis) of breast cancer.
Differential inducibility of p53-downstream genes in human neuroblastoma cell lines. Background: Mutations in the p53 gene are found in more than half of tumors. However, mutation in this gene is rare in neuroblastomas. We studied both the relationship between mutation of the p53 gene and the inducibility of the downstream genes p21, bax and mdm2, and the posttranslational modification of p53 in the human neuroblastoma cell lines GOTO, NMB, and SK-N-BE. Methods: The human neuroblastoma cell lines GOTO, NMB and SK-N-BE and the human osteogenic sarcoma cell line Saos-2 were cultured. DNA sequencing was done with an automated DNA sequencer. Expression of p53, phosphorylated p53, p21, Bax, and MDM2 proteins was determined by immunoblotting. Dual luciferase reporter plasmids with a p53 response element of p21, bax, and mdm2 were constructed and luciferase activity was measured. A mammalian p53 expression plasmid, pXZ53WT, was also constructed and transfected. Results: The homozygous or hemizygous missense mutations in the p53 gene of NMB and SK-N-BE were G to A at nucleotide 733 (G245S) and G to T at nucleotide 404 (C135F), respectively, while GOTO had no mutation at any exon. Doxorubicin was given to induce genotoxic stress, and endogenous p53 accumulation was observed in all cell lines tested. Increases in p21, Bax, and MDM2, in which transcription is directly regulated by p53, did not occur in NMB and SK-N-BE. In GOTO, p21 and MDM2, but not Bax, increased. The transcriptional activities of these genes paralleled the increases in protein levels, except for MDM2 in GOTO. These results indicate that mutant p53 does not contribute to up-regulation of p21, bax, or mdm2. In addition, even in wild-type p53-possessing cells (GOTO) the p53-dependent apoptotic pathway was obstructed. Experiments with a p53 expression plasmid revealed that abnormalities occurred in multiple p53-dependent pathways of neuroblastoma cells with wild-type or mutated p53. p53 phosphorylation ability was noted in cells with mutant p53, indicating that the function of genes regulating upstream of the p53 pathway is retained. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that multiple transcription factors (including p53) that are essential for the full expression of the p53-downstream genes related to cell cycle regulation and induction of apoptosis are inactivated during tumorigenesis in neuroblastoma cells.
The modulatory effects of bHLH transcription factors with the Wnt/β-catenin pathway on differentiation of neural progenitor cells derived from neonatal mouse anterior subventricular zone. The subventricular zone (SVZ) located adjacent to the lateral ventricles is the major site where neural progenitor cells (NPCs) are concentrated in the adult brain. NPCs in the anterior subventricular zone (SVZa) generate neuronal precursors and migrate along a highly localized pathway-the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to the olfactory bulb (OB), where they differentiate into interneurons. To investigate the modulatory effects of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors on differentiation from SVZa NPCs, we firstly examined the distribution of bHLH family members (Mash1, Id2, and Hes1) in cultured mouse SVZa NPCs and evaluated their regulatory effects on differentiation by transfection with Mash1, Id2, or Hes1 eukaryotic expression plasmid. Furthermore, we assessed the effects of bHLH transcription factors on the expression of downstream molecules of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, β-catenin and (Glycogen synthase kinase-3β). Our results demonstrated that Mash1, Id2, Hes1 were all widely expressed in in vitro progenies from mouse SVZa NPCs. Analyses of SVZa NPCs transfected with eukaryotic expression plasmids showed that Mash1 promoted neuronal differentiation from SVZa NPCs, while Id2 and Hes1 repressed neuronal differentiation. In addition, we found that Id2 and Hes1 simulated expression of β-catenin and GSK-3β, while Mash1 inhibited their expression. Our results suggest that the classic bHLH transcription factors, Mash1, Id2 and Hes1, play important roles in the regulation of differentiation from SVZa NPCs. This modulation is possibly mediated by a coordination of bHLH and Wnt/β-catenin signaling
Identification of prognostic biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma via long noncoding RNA expression and copy number alterations. Aim: This study aimed to identify long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) with potential to be prognostic biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by analyzing copy number alterations (CNAs). Methods: RNA Sequencing data of 369 HCC patients was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and analyzed with a series of systematic bioinformatics methods. Results: LncRNA-CNA association analysis revealed that many lncRNAs were located in sites frequently amplified or deleted. Three upregulated lncRNAs (LINC00689, SNHG20 and MAFG-AS1) with copy amplification and one downregulated lncRNA TMEM220-AS1 with copy deletion were associated with poor prognosis of HCC. Conclusion: This study reveals that differentially expressed lncRNAs correlate with CNAs in HCC. Moreover, the differentially expressed lncRNAs and their copy amplification/deletions could be promising prognostic biomarkers of HCC.
Daily variation and light responsiveness of mammalian clock gene, Clock and BMAL1, transcripts in the pineal body and different areas of brain in rats. Expression patterns of mammalian clock genes, Clock and BMAL1, were examined by in situ hybridization in the pineal body, olfactory bulb, hippocampus and cerebellum in rats under constant darkness. In the pineal, the level of Clock transcript was significantly higher at ZT18 (subjective night) than at ZT6 (subjective day), while the level of BMAL1 transcript was significantly higher at ZT6 than at ZT18. A 30 min light pulse did not affect the transcript levels of Clock nor of BMAL1. The Clock expression in the cerebellum was significantly increased at ZT6 than at ZT18, while no difference was detected in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus at these two phases. The BMAL1 expressions in these areas were similar to the case in the pineal. These findings indicate that the mammalian clock gene, Clock and BMAL1, are expressed differently in the different areas of the brain and the pineal.
The BMP ligand Gdf6 prevents differentiation of coronal suture mesenchyme in early cranial development. Growth Differentiation Factor-6 (Gdf6) is a member of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) family of secreted signaling molecules. Previous studies have shown that Gdf6 plays a role in formation of a diverse subset of skeletal joints. In mice, loss of Gdf6 results in fusion of the coronal suture, the intramembranous joint that separates the frontal and parietal bones. Although the role of GDFs in the development of cartilaginous limb joints has been studied, limb joints are developmentally quite distinct from cranial sutures and how Gdf6 controls suture formation has remained unclear. In this study we show that coronal suture fusion in the Gdf6-/- mouse is due to accelerated differentiation of suture mesenchyme, prior to the onset of calvarial ossification. Gdf6 is expressed in the mouse frontal bone primordia from embryonic day (E) 10.5 through 12.5. In the Gdf6-/- embryo, the coronal suture fuses prematurely and concurrently with the initiation of osteogenesis in the cranial bones. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and Runx2 expression assays both showed that the suture width is reduced in Gdf6+/- embryos and is completely absent in Gdf6-/- embryos by E12.5. ALP activity is also increased in the suture mesenchyme of Gdf6+/- embryos compared to wild-type. This suggests Gdf6 delays differentiation of the mesenchyme occupying the suture, prior to the onset of ossification. Therefore, although BMPs are known to promote bone formation, Gdf6 plays an inhibitory role to prevent the osteogenic differentiation of the coronal suture mesenchyme.
CHX10 targets a subset of photoreceptor genes. The homeobox gene CHX10 is required for retinal progenitor cell proliferation early in retinogenesis and subsequently for bipolar neuron differentiation. To clarify the molecular mechanisms employed by CHX10 we sought to identify its target genes. In a yeast one-hybrid assay Chx10 interacted with the Ret1 site of the photoreceptor-specific gene Rhodopsin. Gel shift assays using in vitro translated protein confirmed that CHX10 binds to Ret1, but not to the similar Rhodopsin sites Ret4 and BAT-1. Using retinal nuclear lysates, we observed interactions between Chx10 and additional photoreceptor-specific elements including the PCE-1 (Rod arrestin/S-antigen) and the Cone opsin locus control region (Red/green cone opsin). However, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that in vivo, Chx10 bound sites upstream of the Rod arrestin and Interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein genes but not Rhodopsin or Cone opsin. Thus, in a chromatin context, Chx10 associates with a specific subset of elements that it binds with comparable apparent affinity in vitro. Our data suggest that CHX10 may target these motifs to inhibit rod photoreceptor gene expression in bipolar cells.
Thrombopoietin promotes NHEJ DNA repair in hematopoietic stem cells through specific activation of Erk and NF-kB pathways and their target, IEX-1. Loss of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function and increased risk of developing hematopoietic malignancies are severe and concerning complications of anticancer radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We have previously shown that thrombopoietin (TPO), a critical HSC regulator, ensures HSC chromosomal integrity and function in response to γ-irradiation by regulating their DNA-damage response. TPO directly affects the double-strand break (DSB) repair machinery through increased DNA-protein kinase (DNA-PK) phosphorylation and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair efficiency and fidelity. This effect is not shared by other HSC growth factors, suggesting that TPO triggers a specific signal in HSCs facilitating DNA-PK activation upon DNA damage. The discovery of these unique signaling pathways will provide a means of enhancing TPO-desirable effects on HSCs and improving the safety of anticancer DNA agents.We show here that TPO specifically triggers Erk and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathways in mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Both of these pathways are required for a TPO-mediated increase in DSB repair. They cooperate to induce and activate the early stress-response gene, Iex-1 (ier3), upon DNA damage. Iex-1 forms a complex with pERK and the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK, which is necessary and sufficient to promote TPO-increased DNA-PK activation and NHEJ DSB repair in both mouse and human HSPCs.
Circular RNA TTBK2 regulates cell proliferation, invasion and ferroptosis via miR-761/ITGB8 axis in glioma. OBJECTIVE: Glioma is a primary intracranial tumor with an unfavorable prognosis. Evolving evidence indicates that circular RNA Tau tubulin kinase 2 (circ-TTBK2) is a cancer- associated gene. Therefore, this study was to explore the potential role of circ-TTBK2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Levels of circ- TTBK2, microRNA (miR)-761, and integrin subunit beta 8 (ITGB8) were determined by adopting quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or Western blot. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol- 2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed to detect cell viability, and the invaded cells were distinguished utilizing transwell assay. Iron and lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays were implemented to examine the iron (total iron and ferrous iron) and lipid-based ROS in glioma cells, respectively. Besides, dual- luciferase reporter assay was administrated to illustrate the interaction between miR-761 and circ- TTBK2 or ITGB8. The role of circ-TTBK2 was identified via xenograft tumor model. RESULTS: Levels of circ-TTBK2 and ITGB8 were upregulated, whereas miR-761 level was low-expressed in glioma tissues and cells. Circ- TTBK2 was a sponge of miR-761 to modulate ITGB8. Additionally, circ-TTBK2 knockdown or miR-761 increase could retard cell proliferation, invasion, and promote ferroptosis in glioma cells. Interestingly, miR-761 inhibitor could abolish the repressive impact of circ-TTBK2 silencing on cell growth in vitro. Also, the influence of miR-761 mimic on cell phenotypes was regained after ITGB8 upregulation. Meanwhile, circ-TTBK2 deficiency caused the decrease of tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS: Circ-TTBK2 regulated cell proliferation, invasion and ferroptosis via targeting ITGB8 by sponging miR-761 in glioma, providing a promising biomarker for the clinical therapy of human glioma.
Mrna overexpression of prolyl hydroxylase phd3 is inversely related to nuclear grade in renal cell carcinoma. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relative mRNA expression levels of genes involved in the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) signalling pathway in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and to analyse their associations with clinicopathological parameters and survival outcomes. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used to quantify the mRNA expression levels of HIF-1α, HIF-2α, prolyl hydroxylase (PHD)1, PHD2 and PHD3 in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour tissue samples from 41 patients with RCC, including 33 cases of clear cell RCC (ccRCC). FFPE samples of corresponding adjacent normal kidney tissues were used as a comparison. mRNA expression levels were analysed in regard to clinical parameters, histological type, stage, nuclear grade, cancer specific survival and overall survival. Compared with adjacent normal kidney tissue, HIF-1α levels were lower in 16/33 ccRCC samples (48.48%), while HIF-2α, PHD1 and PHD2 levels did not exhibit a specific expression pattern. By contrast, the PHD3 mRNA level was higher in 29/33 (87.87%) of the tumour samples. HIF-1α was positively associated with HIF-2α, PHD1 and PHD2. HIF-2α levels were associated with PHD1, PHD2 and PHD3, while PHD3 was strongly associated with PHD2. PHD3 mRNA levels were inversely associated with nuclear grade (P=0.015). However, in univariate analysis, PHD3 was not associated with cancer-specific or overall survival rates. The present findings suggest an important involvement of PHD3 in ccRCC, since PHD3 mRNA expression was inversely associated with nuclear grade. However, PHD3 mRNA levels did not have an independent prognostic value. Further studies are required to investigate whether PHD3 could be used as either a therapeutic target or prognostic marker.
Comprehensive Identification of RNA-Binding Domains in Human Cells. Mammalian cells harbor more than a thousand RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), with half of these employing unknown modes of RNA binding. We developed RBDmap to determine the RNA-binding sites of native RBPs on a proteome-wide scale. We identified 1,174 binding sites within 529 HeLa cell RBPs, discovering numerous RNA-binding domains (RBDs). Catalytic centers or protein-protein interaction domains are in close relationship with RNA-binding sites, invoking possible effector roles of RNA in the control of protein function. Nearly half of the RNA-binding sites map to intrinsically disordered regions, uncovering unstructured domains as prevalent partners in protein-RNA interactions. RNA-binding sites represent hot spots for defined posttranslational modifications such as lysine acetylation and tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting metabolic and signal-dependent regulation of RBP function. RBDs display a high degree of evolutionary conservation and incidence of Mendelian mutations, suggestive of important functional roles. RBDmap thus yields profound insights into native protein-RNA interactions in living cells.
Association between ERCC5 gene polymorphisms and gastric cancer risk. We investigate the role of ERCC5 gene polymorphisms (rs17655 and rs751402) in the development of gastric cancer in a Chinese population. A total of 142 gastric cancer patients whose diagnoses were confirmed by pathology, and 274 control subjects were recruited from Tangshan Gongren Hospital between March 2013 and March 2015. Genotyping of ERCC5 rs17655 and rs751402 polymorphisms was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Compared with the control subjects, we found that gastric cancer patients were more likely to be older, smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, and suffer from Helicobacter pylori infection. Using a chi-square test, a significant difference was observed in the distribution ofERCC5 rs751402 genotypes between patient and control groups (chi-square = 7.79, P = 0.02). In addition, unconditional multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the AA genotype of rs751402 significantly increased gastric cancer risk compared to the GG genotype [odds ratio (OR) = 2.61, 95%CI = 1.23-5.49; P = 0.005]. Moreover, we found that the AA genotype correlated with elevated risk of gastric cancer when compared to the GG+AG genotype under a recessive model (OR = 2.21, 95%CI = 1.11-4.39; P = 0.01). In conclusion, we suggest that the ERCC5 rs751402 polymorphism is associated with development of gastric cancer.
Targeted DNA methylation in vivo using an engineered dCas9-MQ1 fusion protein. Comprehensive studies have shown that DNA methylation plays vital roles in both loss of pluripotency and governance of the transcriptome during embryogenesis and subsequent developmental processes. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns have been widely observed in tumorigenesis, ageing and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting the importance of a systematic understanding of DNA methylation and the dynamic changes of methylomes during disease onset and progression. Here we describe a facile and convenient approach for efficient targeted DNA methylation by fusing inactive Cas9 (dCas9) with an engineered prokaryotic DNA methyltransferase MQ1. Our study presents a rapid and efficient strategy to achieve locus-specific cytosine modifications in the genome without obvious impact on global methylation in 24 h. Finally, we demonstrate our tool can induce targeted CpG methylation in mice by zygote microinjection, thereby demonstrating its potential utility in early development.
Adipose stromal cells differentiation toward smooth muscle cell phenotype diminishes their vasculogenic activity due to induction of activin A secretion. Adipose stromal cells (ASCs) support endothelial cell (EC) vasculogenesis through paracrine and cell-contact communications. In addition, ASCs differentiate towards the smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotype under different stimuli, which prompted their use as a source of mural cells in fabricating small calibre vessels. How ASCs' SMC-lineage commitment affects their subsequent communication with ECs is unknown. The vasculogenic characteristics of human ASCs in progenitor stage and after differentiation towards SMC phenotype were analysed in the present study. Exposure to transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) or activin A has induced expression of SMC markers in ASCs. Analysis performed after treatment withdrawal revealed that secretome of pre-differentiated ASCs had a reduced potency to support EC survival and these ASCs had diminished ability to support EC vasculogenesis in vitro. Vascularization of subcutaneous implants carrying a mixture of ECs and ASCs was 50% lower when, instead of control, pre-differentiated ASCs were used. Pre-differentiated ASCs had an inferior mitogenic response to EC-produced factors. Differentiation of ASCs was accompanied by upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor and a decrease in hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) production; however, addition of HGF to the co-culture incubation media did not improve vasculogenesis. In parallel, ASC treatment with TGFβ1 induced secretion of activin A. Augmenting co-culture incubation media with anti-activin A IgG restored the ability of pre-differentiated ASCs to support vasculogenesis to the same degree as control ASCs. The present study suggests that TGFβ1 or activin A-induced ASC commitment to SMC phenotype negatively affects the ability of ASCs to support EC vasculogenesis in applications based on EC and ASC co-injection into target tissues.
Study to determine the presence of progenitor cells in the degenerated human cartilage endplates. Introduction Cartilage endplate (CEP) degeneration is usually accompanied by loss of cellularity, and this loss may be a crucial key factor in initiation and development of degenerative disc disease. The study of cell types in degenerated CEP could help in understanding CEP etiopathogenesis, and may help in devising new treatments, especially if the presence of progenitor cells could be demonstrated. The aim of this study was to determine if progenitor cells existed in degenerated human CEP. Materials and methods Cells isolated from CEP were cultured in a three-dimensional agarose suspension to screen for proliferative cell clusters. Cell clusters were then expanded in vitro and the populations were analyzed for colony forming unit, immunophenotype, multilineage induction, and expression of stem cell-related genes. Results The presence of progenitor cells in degenerated human CEP is indicated by the results of CFU, immunophenotype, multilineage induction, and expression of stem cell-related genes. Conclusions We believe that this is the first study which has conclusively shown the presence of progenitor cells in degenerated CEP. The finding of this study may influence the clinical management of degenerative disc disorder.
Genetic alterations in gastric cancer cell lines and their original tissues. To investigate the genetic changes that occur during establishment of gastric cancer cell lines, 4 gastric cancer cell lines and their original tumor tissues were examined for microsatellite instability (MSI), loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and p53 mutation. MSI status did not change during the establishment, though the cell lines gained frameshift mutation in some of the genes with polytract coding sequences. There was no difference in p53 mutation between the cell lines and the original tumors. The frequency of LOH was similar between the cell lines and each original tumor, in the range 30.8% to 85.7%. The difference in the LOH results between the cell lines and the original tumors was not greater than the difference between the different areas of the original tumors. The above results suggested that most of the genetic alterations, such as MSI, LOH, and p53 gene mutation, were sustained during the establishment of gastric cancer cell lines. Minor genetic differences between original tumor tissues and cancer cell lines could be explained as a tumor heterogeneity because separate areas of the original tumor tissues manifest similar variations.
Comparative mapping of the constitutional and tumor-associated 11;22 translocations. The reciprocal t(11;22)(q23;q11) is the most common non-Robertsonian constitutional translocation in humans. The tumor-associated 11;22 rearrangement of Ewing sarcoma (ES) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (NE) is cytologically very similar to the 11;22 constitutional rearrangement. Using immunoglobulin light-chain constant region, ETS1 probes, and the technique of in situ hybridization, we previously were able to show that the constitutional and ES/NE breakpoints are different. As a first step toward isolating these translocation junctions and to further distinguish between them, we have made somatic cell hybrids. Cells from a constitutional 46,XX,inv(9),t(11;22) carrier and from an ES cell line with a t(11;22) were separately fused to a hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient Chinese hamster cell line (RJK88). Resulting clones were screened with G-banding and Southern hybridization. Hybrid clones derived from the constitutional t(11;22) were established which contained the der(22) and both the der(22) and the der(11). Hybrid clones derived from the ES cell line containing the der(11) were isolated. Using the technique of Southern hybridization we have sublocalized the loci; ApoA1/C3, CD3D, ETS1, PBGD, THY1, D11S29, D11S34, and D11S147 to the region between the two breakpoints on chromosome 11 and V(λI), V(λVI), V(λVII), and D22S10 to the region between the breakpoints on chromosome 22. Using anonymous DNA probes, we found that D22S9 and D22S24 map proximal to the constitutional breakpoint and that D22S15 and D22S32 map distal to the ES breakpoint on chromosome 22.
Genetic control of NKT cell numbers maps to major diabetes and lupus loci. Natural killer T cells are an immunoregulatory population of lymphocytes that plays a critical role in controlling the adaptive immune system and contributes to the regulation of autoimmune responses. We have previously reported deficiencies in the numbers and function of NKT cells in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse strain, a well-validated model of type 1 diabetes and systemic lupus erythematosus. In this study, we report the results of a genetic linkage analysis of the genes controlling NKT cell numbers in a first backcross (BC1) from C57BL/6 to NOD.Nkrp1b mice. The numbers of thymic NKT cells of 320 BC1 mice were determined by fluorescence-activated cell analysis using anti-TCR Ab and CD1/α-galactosylceramide tetramer. Tail DNA of 138 female BC1 mice was analyzed for PCR product length polymorphisms at 181 simple sequence repeats, providing greater than 90% coverage of the autosomal genome with an average marker separation of 8 cM. Two loci exhibiting significant linkage to NKT cell numbers were identified; the most significant (Nkt1) was on distal chromosome 1, in the same region as the NOD mouse lupus susceptibility gene Babs2/Bana3. The second most significant locus (Nkt2) mapped to the same region as Idd13, a NOD-derived diabetes susceptibility gene on chromosome 2.
FADD/MORT1, a signal transducer that can promote cell death or cell growth. FADD/MORT1 is a cytosolic adaptor protein which is critical for signalling from CD95 (Fas/APO-1) and certain other members of the tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) family (called 'death receptors'). Two protein interaction domains have been identified in FADD/MORT1. The C-terminal 'death domain' is needed for recruitment of FADD/MORT1 to ligated 'death receptors' and the N-terminal 'death effector domain' mediates oligomerisation and activation of caspase-8 zymogens. Caspase-8 activates other cysteine proteases by cleavage and this starts a proteolytic cascade which constitutes the 'point of no return' in apoptosis signalling. Experiments in mice lacking FADD/MORT1 function proved that this adaptor is required for CD95- and TNF-RI-transduced cell death but is dispensable for other pathways to apoptosis. Surprisingly, FADD/MORT1 is also essential for mitogen-induced proliferation of T-lymphocytes. Therapeutic activation of FADD/MORT1 function may be used to kill unwanted cells in cancer or autoimmunity and its suppression may help prevent cell death in certain degenerative disorders.
Activation of PKA/CREB Signaling is Involved in BMP9-Induced Osteogenic Differentiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells. Background/Aims: BMP9 is highly capable of promoting osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) although the molecular mechanism involved is largely unknown. Here, we explored the detail role of PKA/CREB signaling in BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation. Methods: Activation status of PKA/CREB signaling is assessed by nonradioactive assay and Western blot. Using PKA inhibitors and a dominant negative protein of CREB (A-CREB), we investigated the effect of PKA/CREB signaling on BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation. Results: We found that BMP9 promotes PKA activity and enhances CREB phosphorylation in MSCs. BMP9 is shown to down-regulate protein kinase A inhibitor γ (PKIγ) expression. We demonstrated that PKA inhibitors suppress BMP9-induced early osteogenic marker alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in MSCs as well as late osteogenic markers osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin (OCN) and matrix mineralization. We found that PKA inhibitor reduces BMP9-induced Runx2 activation and p38 phosphorylation in MSCs. Lastly, interference of CREB function by A-CREB decreased BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation as well. Conclusion: Our results revealed that BMP9 may activate PKA/CREB signaling in MSCs through suppression of PKIγ expression. It is noteworthy that inhibition of PKA/CREB signaling may impair BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, implying that activation of PKA/CREB signaling is required for BMP9 osteoinductive activity.
Modification of histocompatibility antigen expression in cells expressing activated oncogenes: Implications for tumour development. The down-regulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen expression which occurs in tumours may be an important element in tumour progression - the increasing malignancy of tumours - which is so much a feature of cancer - if it allowed the avoidance of T-cell immunity. Obviously, this downregulation could be due to a wide variety of mechanisms. An interesting possibility is that some oncogenes may directly influence MHC gene expression, perhaps at several different levels. The way in which oncogenes work-through signal transduction and transcription controls - suggests how this could happen. Three examples of oncogenes for which there is evidence that their expression modulates MHC gene expression and adenovirus E1A, myc and ras.
The IL-1 family of cytokines. Do they have a role in scleroderma fibrosis?. Systemic sclerosis is a profibrotic autoimmune disease mediated by the dysregulation in collagen synthesis, leading to the increased deposition of collagens, primarily type I and III, and the deposition of other extracellular matrix proteins in the skin and internal organs, in a mechanism that is thought to be an over active wound healing process. These patients experience significant morbidity and the mortality rate in this disease is high. Indeed, scleroderma is the most deadly of diseases in the autoimmune spectrum. Recent evidence has placed the assembly and chronic activation of the inflammasome as a central driver of fibrosis. Once assembled, the inflammasome is a large protein complex that regulates the release of IL-1, IL-18, and IL-33, which are thought to play a role in the fibrotic response. IL-36 also belongs to the IL-1 family of cytokines and is a new comer to this field of research. Recent analyses of the IL-1 family of cytokines have demonstrated that many of them play a role in skin inflammation and fibrosis and their corresponding antagonists (IL-1RA and IL-36RA) can abrogate this pathology. Understanding how these cytokines are regulated and how they contribute to fibrosis will be important to understanding this pathology and may shed light in new areas for therapeutic development.
The histone methyltransferase Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 1-like 1 (WHSC1L1) is involved in human carcinogenesis. Histone lysine methylation plays a fundamental role in chromatin organization. Although a set of histone methyltransferases have been identified and biochemically characterized, the pathological roles of their dysfunction in human cancers are still not well understood. In this study, we demonstrate important roles of WHSC1L1 in human carcinogenesis. Expression levels of WHSC1L1 transcript were significantly elevated in various human cancers including bladder carcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis of bladder, lung, and liver cancers confirmed overexpression of WHSC1L1. WHSC1L1-specific small interfering RNAs significantly knocked down its expression and resulted in suppression of proliferation of bladder and lung cancer cell lines. WHSC1L1 knockdown induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase followed by multinucleation of cancer cells. Expression profile analysis using Affymetrix GeneChip® showed that WHSC1L1 affected the expression of a number of genes including CCNG1 and NEK7, which are known to play crucial roles in the cell cycle progression at mitosis. As WHSC1L1 expression is significantly low in various normal tissues including vital organs, WHSC1L1 could be a good candidate molecule for development of novel treatment for various types of cancer.
Human papillomavirus (HPV)-18 E6 oncoprotein interferes with the epithelial cell polarity Par3 protein. High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the principal risk factor for the development of cervical cancer. The HPV E6 oncoprotein has the ability to target and interfere with several PSD-95/DLG/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain-containing proteins that are involved in the control of cell polarity. This function can be significant for E6 oncogenic activity because a deficiency in cell polarisation is a marker of tumour progression. The establishment and control of polarity in epithelial cells depend on the correct asymmetrical distribution of proteins and lipids at the cell borders and on specialised cell junctions. In this report, we have investigated the effects of HPV E6 protein on the polarity machinery, with a focus on the PDZ partitioning defective 3 (Par3) protein, which is a key component of tight junctions (TJ) and the polarity network. We demonstrate that E6 is able to bind and induce the mislocalisation of Par3 protein in a PDZ-dependent manner without significant reduction in Par3 protein levels. In addition, the high-risk HPV-18 E6 protein promotes a delay in TJ formation when analysed by calcium switch assays. Taken together, the data presented in this study contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanism by which HPVs induce the loss of cell polarity, with potential implications for the development and progression of HPV-associated tumours.
The polymorphism of CLOCK gene rs4864548 A&gt;G is associated with susceptibility of Alzheimer’s disease in Chinese population. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between polymorphism of circadian locomotor output cycle kaput (CLOCK) gene rs4864548 A/G and susceptibility of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A total of 296 unrelated AD patients and 423 control subjects were enrolled in the case-control study. Genotypes of apolipoprotein E (APOE) and CLOCK gene rs4864548 A/G were determined by a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism detection method. Our results showed that in the whole sample or APOE ε 4 non-carriers, prevalence of A carriers in CLOCK gene rs4864548 A/G in AD patients was remarkably higher than that in control subjects (in the whole sample: χ2 = 47.614, p < 0.0001; in APOE ε 4 non-carriers: χ2 = 22.493, p < 0.0001). However, among APOE ε 4 carriers, the difference in the prevalence of A carriers in CLOCK gene rs4864548 A/G between AD patients and controls was no statistically significant (χ2 = 0.669, p = 0.379). These findings demonstrate that A carriers in CLOCK gene rs 4864548 A/G were closely related to a high susceptibility of AD among APOE ε 4 non-carriers while the functional polymorphism of CLOCK gene rs4864548 A/G was not associated with the susceptibility of AD among APOE ε 4 carriers.
'DDX58 (RIG-I)-related disease is associated with tissue-specific interferon pathway activation. Background Singleton-Merten syndrome (SGMRT) is a rare immunogenetic disorder that variably features juvenile open-angle glaucoma (JOAG), psoriasiform skin rash, aortic calcifications and skeletal and dental dysplasia. Few families have been described and the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum is poorly defined, with variants in DDX58 (DExD/H-box helicase 58) being one of two identified causes, classified as SGMRT2. Methods Families underwent deep systemic phenotyping and exome sequencing. Functional characterisation with in vitro luciferase assays and in vivo interferon signature using bulk and single cell RNA sequencing was performed. Results We have identified a novel DDX58 variant c.1529A>T p.(Glu510Val) that segregates with disease in two families with SGMRT2. Patients in these families have widely variable phenotypic features and different ethnic background, with some being severely affected by systemic features and others solely with glaucoma. JOAG was present in all individuals affected with the syndrome. Furthermore, detailed evaluation of skin rash in one patient revealed sparse inflammatory infiltrates in a unique distribution. Functional analysis showed that the DDX58 variant is a dominant gain-of-function activator of interferon pathways in the absence of exogenous RNA ligands. Single cell RNA sequencing of patient lesional skin revealed a cellular activation of interferon-stimulated gene expression in keratinocytes and fibroblasts but not in neighbouring healthy skin. Conclusions These results expand the genotypic spectrum of DDX58-associated disease, provide the first detailed description of ocular and dermatological phenotypes, expand our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this condition and provide a platform for testing response to therapy
2′-Hydroxyflavanone inhibits prostate tumor growth through inactivation of AKT/STAT3 signaling and induction of cell apoptosis. Although there have been advances in therapeutic regimes for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), these recent developments have not led to improved cure rates. Thus, more novel agents to prolong patient survival are desired. 2′-Hydroxyflavanone (2HF), a nontoxic natural flavonoid, has been shown to exhibit pleiotropic anticancer effects in many cancer types, including prostate cancer (PCa). However, the therapeutic effects of 2HF on tumor growth and its potential mechanisms in CRPC have not been completely elucidated. In the present study, utilizing three different metastatic and androgen-independent PCa cell models (PC-3, DU145 and C4-2), we found that 2HF treatment not only resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro, but also delayed subcutaneous tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, besides its known inhibitory effects on aldo-keto reductase activity and de novo a ndrogen synthesis, 2 HF also markedly suppressed AKT phosphorylation, signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) phosphorylation and transactivation subsequently regulating the expression of members of the BCL-2 family (i.e., Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bax) and modulating caspase-mediated cell apoptosis. Overall, this study revealed a novel mechanism for 2HF targeting metastatic CRPC, in which inactivation of AKT/STAT3 signaling led to cell apoptosis and growth inhibition.
Cellular localisation and co-expression of somatostatin receptor messenger RNAs in the human brain. Genes for five high affinity somatostatin receptors, named sst1-5, have been cloned recently. In this study we describe the tissue distribution and cellular localisation of mRNA encoding sst1, sst3 and sst4 receptors in the human cerebellum, frontal cortex (Brodmann's area 11) and hippocampus. RT-PCR and in situ hybridisation studies indicated a distinct, but partially overlapping pattern of expression of the receptor mRNAs. In situ hybridisation studies using co-expression techniques with probes for sst1, sst3 and sst4 receptor mRNA on paraffin sections revealed the presence of neurones expressing more than one somatostatin receptor mRNA type in both the hippocampus and pyramidal cells of layer V of the frontal cortex.
MHC class II deficiency: A disease of gene regulation. Primary human immunodeficiencies are a heterogenous group of inborn errors of the immune system. Among them, MHC class II deficiency (MHC-II deficiency) is caused by the absence of MHC-II expression on the cell surface. The disease was named "major histocompatibility complex class II deficiency" but it is also frequently referred to as the "bare lymphocyte syndrome" (BLS). The disease is due to defects in transacting regulatory factors required for expression of MHC-II genes. The affected genes are now known to encode at least 4 distinct regulatory factors controlling transcription of MHC-II genes. These transacting factors, called CIITA, RFXANK, RFX5, and RFXAP, are essential and specific for the MHC class II gene expression. Thus, while all patients have very similar clinical findings, the genetic defects are heterogenous, with mutations in 1 of these 4 transacting factors. Here, we review the clinical and molecular features that characterize MHC-II deficiency and discuss therapy options.
Cloning and characterization of two distinct human extracellular signal- regulated kinase activator kinases, MEK1 and MEK2. Mitogen-induced signal transduction is mediated by a cascade of protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. One of the immediate responses of mitogen stimulation is the activation of a family of protein kinases known as mitogen-activated protein kinase or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). MEK (MAP kinase or ERK kinase) is the immediate upstream activator kinase of ERK. Two cDNAs, MEK1 and MEK2, were cloned and sequenced. MEK1 and MEK2 encode 393 and 400 amino acid residues, respectively. The human MEK1 shares 99% amino acid sequence identity with the murine MEK1 and 80% with human MEK2. Both MEK1 and MEK2 were expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to be able to activate recombinant human ERK1 in vitro. The purified MEK2 protein stimulated threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation on ERK1 and concomitantly activated ERK1 kinase activity more than 100-fold. The recombinant MEK2 showed lower activity as an ERK activator as compared with MEK purified from tissue. However, the recombinant MEK2 can be activated by serum-stimulated cell extract in vitro. MEKs, in a manner similar to ERKs, are likely to consist of a family of related proteins playing critical roles in signal transduction.
CRY Drives Cyclic CK2-Mediated BMAL1 Phosphorylation to Control the Mammalian Circadian Clock. Intracellular circadian clocks, composed of clock genes that act in transcription-translation feedback loops, drive global rhythmic expression of the mammalian transcriptome and allow an organism to anticipate to the momentum of the day. Using a novel clock-perturbing peptide, we established a pivotal role for casein kinase (CK)-2-mediated circadian BMAL1-Ser90 phosphorylation (BMAL1-P) in regulating central and peripheral core clocks. Subsequent analysis of the underlying mechanism showed a novel role of CRY as a repressor for protein kinase. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments and real-time monitoring of protein–protein interactions revealed that CRY-mediated periodic binding of CK2β to BMAL1 inhibits BMAL1-Ser90 phosphorylation by CK2α. The FAD binding domain of CRY1, two C-terminal BMAL1 domains, and particularly BMAL1-Lys537 acetylation/deacetylation by CLOCK/SIRT1, were shown to be critical for CRY-mediated BMAL1–CK2β binding. Reciprocally, BMAL1-Ser90 phosphorylation is prerequisite for BMAL1-Lys537 acetylation. We propose a dual negative-feedback model in which a CRY-dependent CK2-driven posttranslational BMAL1–P-BMAL1 loop is an integral part of the core clock oscillator.
GANT61 plays antitumor effects by inducing oxidative stress through the miRNA-1286/RAB31 axis in osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma (OS) is a rare malignancy of bone associated with poor clinical outcomes. The antitumor effects of GANT61 on OS is unclear. To investigate antitumor effects and mechanism of GANT61 in OS cells and xenograft model. Effects of GANT61 on cell viability, clone formation, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration, and invasion ability of OS cells were assessed. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels measured by dichlorofluorescein fluorescence were used to evaluate oxidative stress. The Xenograft model was constructed to investigate the antitumor effects of GANT61 in vivo. The microRNA (miRNA)-1286 was downregulated, while RAB31 upregulated in OS tissues and cells. GANT61 inhibited viability, migration, and invasion ability of OS cells (SaOS-2 and U2OS), and induced apoptosis and the ROS production, along with miRNA-1286 upregulation and RAB13 downregulation. After knockdown of miRNA-1286, GANT6-induced cell inhibition was attenuated, along with RAB31 upregulation. Inversely, miRNA-1286 overexpression downregulated RAB31. Dual-luciferase reporter assay verified that miR-1286 negatively targeted RAB13. Moreover, the knockdown of RAB31 stimulated apoptosis and ROS production while inhibited viability, migration, and invasion of GANT61-treated cells. In vivo experiments further confirmed that GANT61 inhibited tumor growth and RAB13 expression, but enhanced miRNA-1286. The study demonstrated that GANT61 inhibited cell aggressive phenotype and tumor growth by inducing oxidative stress through the miRNA-1286/RAB31 axis. Our findings provided a potential antitumor agent for the OS clinical treatment.
Molecular architecture and assembly of the DDB1-CUL4A ubiquitin ligase machinery. Protein ubiquitination is a common form of post-translational modification that regulates a broad spectrum of protein substrates in diverse cellular pathways. Through a three-enzyme (E1-E2-E3) cascade, the attachment of ubiquitin to proteins is catalysed by the E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is best represented by the superfamily of the cullin-RING complexes. Conserved from yeast to human, the DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 complex is a recently identified cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase, which regulates DNA repair, DNA replication and transcription, and can also be subverted by pathogenic viruses to benefit viral infection. Lacking a canonical SKP1-like cullin adaptor and a defined substrate recruitment module, how the DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 E3 apparatus is assembled for ubiquitinating various substrates remains unclear. Here we present crystallographic analyses of the virally hijacked form of the human DDB1-CUL4A-ROC1 machinery, which show that DDB1 uses one β-propeller domain for cullin scaffold binding and a variably attached separate double-β-propeller fold for substrate presentation. Through tandem-affinity purification of human DDB1 and CUL4A complexes followed by mass spectrometry analysis, we then identify a novel family of WD40-repeat proteins, which directly bind to the double-propeller fold of DDB1 and serve as the substrate-recruiting module of the E3. Together, our structural and proteomic results reveal the structural mechanisms and molecular logic underlying the assembly and versatility of a new family of cullin-RING E3 complexes.
Polymorphisms in melatonin synthesis pathways: Possible influences on depression. Background: It has been reported that rs4446909, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter of acetylserotonin methyltransferase (ASMT), influences the expression of the ASMT enzyme. The common G allele is associated with lower ASMT activity, and therefore, diminishes conversion of N-acetylserotonin to melatonin. The G allele was associated with recurrent depressive disorder in a Polish group. ASMT might also affect bipolar relapse, given evidence that N-acetylserotonin might stimulate TRKB receptors, and TRKB may influence mood relapse in bipolar disorder. Additionally, arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) polymorphisms have been reported associated with depression, perhaps through their influence upon N-acetylserotonin or melatonin synthesis.Results: To replicate and further explore these ideas, rs4446909 was genotyped in four research groups, as part of a panel of 610 SNPs surveyed by an Illumina Golden Gate assay. In 768 cases with delayed sleep phase disorder or matched controls, rs4446909 was indeed associated with the depressive symptoms on a self-report scale (P = 0.01, R2 = 0.007). However, there was no significant association of rs4446909 with self-reported depression in a sleep clinic patient group or with two groups of elderly men and women from multicenter studies, nor was the response to lithium treatment associated with rs4446909 in bipolar patients. No associations of two AANAT SNPs with depression were found.Conclusions: The evidence did not support a strong influence of rs4446909 upon mood, but the partial replication may be consistent with a modest effect. It is possible that larger or younger subject groups with improved phenotype ascertainment might demonstrate more persuasive replication.
Plasma miRNA-155 levels predict atrial fibrillation recurrence after cardioversion. Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are widely involved in the regulation of physiological processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and lipid metabolism. They might be associated with the pathological process of atrial fibrillation (AF). The purpose of our study is to investigate whether plasma miRNA-155 levels have a relationship with AF recurrence. Methods: A total of 110 patients with AF were studied, all with successful cardioversion. We measured the expression of plasma miRNA-155 in the recurrent group (n = 30) and in the nonrecurrent group (n = 80) by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In addition, the serumal levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), total cholesterol (TC), and fasting blood glucose (FBG) in the groups were determined by using an automatic biochemical analyzer; and an immunoenzymatic method was applied to determine the serumal levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The left atrial diameter (LAD) and left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of all patients were measured by using echocardiography. Results: Our RT-PCR analysis found that miRNA-155 was significantly upregulated in the recurrent group compared with the nonrecurrent group. These increases of LAD and the levels of BNP, TNF-α, CRP, and IL-6 in the recurrent group were also revealed to be relative to those in the nonrecurrent group. There were no differences in the levels of TC and FBG, as well as in EF, between the groups. Moreover, miRNA-155 expression was observed to correlate positively with these outcomes of LAD, BNP, TNF-α, CRP, IL-6, and LAD. A diagnostic significance of predicting AF recurrence for plasma miRNA-155 was elucidated via ROC curve analysis. Conclusions: Our findings revealed that plasma miRNA-155 can present an ability to calculate AF recurrence after cardioversion.
Two Autism/Dyslexia Linked Variations of DOCK4 Disrupt the Gene Function on Rac1/Rap1 Activation, Neurite Outgrowth, and Synapse Development. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and dyslexia are both neurodevelopmental disorders with high prevalence in children. Both disorders have strong genetic basis, and share similar social communication deficits co-occurring with impairments of reading or language. However, whether these two disorders share common genetic risks remain elusive. DOCK4 (dedicator for cytokinesis 4), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Rac1, is one of few genes that are associated with both ASD and dyslexia. Dock4 is important for neuronal development and social behaviors. Two DOCK4 variations, Exon27-52 deletion (protein product: Dock4-945VS) and a missense mutation at rs2074130 (protein product: Dock4-R853H), are associated with dyslexia and/or ASD with reading difficulties. The present study explores the molecular and cellular functions of these two DOCK4 variants on neuronal development, by comparing them with the wild-type Dock4 protein. Notably, it is revealed that both mutants of Dock4 showed decreased ability to activate not only Rac1, but also another small GTPase Rap1. Consistently, both mutants were dysfunctional for regulation of cell morphology and cytoskeleton. Using Neuro-2a cells and hippocampus neurons as models, we found that both mutants had compromised function in promoting neurite outgrowth and dendritic spine formation. Electrophysiological recordings further showed that R853H partially lost the ability to promote excitatory synaptic transmission, whereas 945VS totally lost the ability. Together, we identified R853 as a previously uncharacterized site for the regulation of the integrity of Dock4 function, and provides insights in understanding the common molecular pathophysiology of ASD and dyslexia.
Effect of matrix metalloproteinase-26 (MMP-26) during embryo implantation in the mouse. Matrix metalloproteinase-26 (MMP-26, endometase and matrilysin-2), a novel member of the MMPs family, is detected not only in the placenta and uterus, but is widely expressed in malignant tumors from different sources as well as in diverse tumor cell lines. However, the function of MMP-26 in the reproductive system has never been reported. Expression of MMP-26 in mouse embryos and the function of the MMP-26 antibody during mouse embryo implantation was examined for the first time by injecting the uterine horn, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, co-culture of mouse blastocysts and uterine monolayer epithelial cells, Western blot, RT-PCR, Northern blot and zymography. Our results show that there is strong expression of MMP-26 mRNA and protein in the mouse embryo. Furthermore, the MMP-26 antibody dramatically inhibited mouse embryo implantation and significantly inhibited adhesion and outgrowth of mouse blastocysts on in vitro uterine monolayer epithelial cells. At the same time, the MMP-26 antibody inhibited the expression of integrin αV mRNA and protein in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that MMP-26 may play a role in some of the tissue-remodeling events associated with the invasion of the endometrium by trophoblast cells and facilitate successfully embryo implantation.
Interplay of LIS1 and MeCP2: Interactions and Implications With the Neurodevelopmental Disorders Lissencephaly and Rett Syndrome. LIS1 is the main causative gene for lissencephaly, while MeCP2 is the main causative gene for Rett syndrome, both of which are neurodevelopmental diseases. Here we report nuclear functions for LIS1 and identify previously unrecognized physical and genetic interactions between the products of these two genes in the cell nucleus, that has implications on MeCP2 organization, neuronal gene expression and mouse behavior. Reduced LIS1 levels affect the association of MeCP2 with chromatin. Transcriptome analysis of primary cortical neurons derived from wild type, Lis1±, MeCP2−/y, or double mutants mice revealed a large overlap in the differentially expressed (DE) genes between the various mutants. Overall, our findings provide insights on molecular mechanisms involved in the neurodevelopmental disorders lissencephaly and Rett syndrome caused by dysfunction of LIS1 and MeCP2, respectively.
Biphasic regulation of transcription factor nuclear factor-κB activity in human endothelial cells by lysophosphatidylcholine through protein kinase C-mediated pathway. Lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC), which is generated in oxidized LDL (Ox-LDL) and abundantly exists in atherosclerotic arterial walls, has been shown to alter various endothelial functions and induces several endothelial genes expressed in atherosclerotic arterial walls. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), a pleiotropic transcription factor, plays an important role in regulation of expression of various genes implicated in atherosclerosis. We have previously reported that lysoPC transferred from Ox-LDL to endothelial surface membrane activates endothelial protein kinase C (PKC), leading to modulated endothelial functions. This study was aimed at determining whether lysoPC could modulate activity of transcription factors in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by using electrophoretic mobility shift assay. LysoPC was found to increase DNA-binding activity of NF-κB in HUVECs within 15 minutes, which peaked at 1 to 2 hours and subsequently declined to the baseline level at 6 hours. Lower concentrations (5 to 15 μmol/L) of lysoPC markedly increased NF-κB activity, but higher concentration (50 μmol/L) of lysoPC inhibited the activity. Phorbol 12- myristate 13-acetate, a potent activator of PKC, also augmented NF-κB activity in HUVECs, mimicking the effects of lysoPC; furthermore, calphostin C and chelerythrine chloride, specific PKC inhibitors, and α-tocopherol, a clinically potent PKC inhibitor, suppressed the lysoPC-induced NF-κB activation. These results indicate that lysoPC regulates NF-κB activity in a biphasic manner dependent on its concentrations and incubation time in human endothelial cells and the endothelial PKC activation may in part be involved in the lysoPC-induced NF-κB activation. Thus, the time course and the positive and negative biphasic regulatory actions of lysoPC on NF-κB activity in endothelial cells might exhibit a unique effect of lysoPC in arterial walls on the different stages of atherosclerosis.
Targeting HMGB1 by ethyl pyruvate ameliorates systemic lupus erythematosus and reverses the senescent phenotype of bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease involving multiple organs and systems. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from SLE patients have demonstrated defects such as impaired growth, senescence phenotype and immunomodulatory functions. Some studies have suggested the close connection between inflammation microenvironment and cellular senescence. In the current study, we detected cytokines levels in bone marrow supernatant by the quantitative proteomics analysis, and found the expression of HMGB1 was remarkably increased in bone marrow from SLE patients. Senescence associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining, F-actin staining and flow cytometry were used to detect the senescence of cells. After stimulation of HMGB1 in normal MSCs, the ratio of SA-β-gal positive in BM-MSCs was increased, the organization of cytoskeleton was disordered, and TLR4-NF-κB signaling was activated. Finally, Ethyl pyruvate (EP) (40 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg, three times a week), a high security HMGB1 inhibitor, was injected intraperitoneally to treat MRL/lpr mice for 8 weeks. We demonstrated that EP alleviated the clinical aspects of lupus nephritis and prolonged survival of MRL/lpr mice. In the meantime, EP reversed the senescent phenotype of BM-MSCs from MRL/lpr mice. HMGB1 could be a promising target in SLE patients, and might be one of the reasons of recurrence after MSCs transplantation.
Precursor of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF) forms a complex with huntingtin-associated protein-1 (HAP1) and sortilin that modulates proBDNF trafficking, degradation, and processing. proBDNF, a precursor of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), is anterogradely transported and released from nerve terminals, but the mechanism underlying this process remains unclear. In this study, we report that proBDNF forms a complex with Huntingtin associated protein-1 (HAP1) and sortilin, which plays an important role in proBDNF intracellular trafficking and stabilization. The interaction of proBDNF with both HAP1A and sortilin in co-transfected HEK293 cells is confirmed by both fluorescence resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation. The frequent co-localization (>90%) of endogenous HAP1, sortilin, and proBDNF is also found in cultured cortical neurons. Mapping studies using GST pulldown and competition assays has defined the interacting region of HAP1 with proBDNF within amino acids 371-445 and the binding sequences of proBDNF to HAP1 between amino acids 65 and 90. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching confirms the defective movement of proBDNF-containing vesicles in neurites of HAP1-/-neurons, which can be partially restored by reintroducing HAP1 cDNA into the neurons. However, the effect is significantly increased by simultaneously reintroducing both HAP1 and sortilin. proBDNF and HAP1 are highly co-localized with organelle markers for the Golgi network, microtubules, molecular motor, or endosomes in normal neurons, but this co-localization is reduced in HAP1-/- neurons. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot showed that sortilin stabilizes the proBDNF·HAP1 complex in co-transfected HEK293 cells, helping to prevent proBDNF degradation. Furthermore, the complex facilitates furin cleavage to release mature BDNF.
Effect of mutations in the β5-β7 loop on the structure and properties of human small heat shock protein HSP22 (HspB8, H11). The human genome encodes ten different small heat shock proteins, each of which contains the so-called α-crystallin domain consisting of 80-100 residues and located in the C-terminal part of the molecule. The α-crystallin domain consists of six or seven β-strands connected by different size loops and combined in two β-sheets. Mutations in the loop connecting the β5 and β7 strands and conservative residues of β7 in αA-, αB-crystallin and HSP27 correlate with the development of different congenital diseases. To understand the role of this part of molecule in the structure and function of small heat shock proteins, we mutated two highly conservative residues (K137 and K141) of human HSP22 and investigated the properties of the K137E and K137,141E mutants. These mutations lead to a decrease in intrinsic Trp fluorescence and the double mutation decreased fluorescence resonance energy transfer from Trp to bis-ANS bound to HSP22. Mutations K137E and especially K137,141E lead to an increase in unordered structure in HSP22 and increased susceptibility to trypsinolysis. Both mutations decreased the probability of dissociation of small oligomers of HSP22, and mutation K137E increased the probability of HSP22 crosslinking. The wild-type HSP22 possessed higher chaperone-like activity than their mutants when insulin or rhodanase were used as the model substrates. Because conservative Lys residues located in the β5-β7 loop and in the β7 strand appear to play an important role in the structure and properties of HSP22, mutations in this part of the small heat shock protein molecule might have a deleterious effect and often correlate with the development of different congenital diseases.
Invasive lobular carcinomas do not express basal cytokeratin markers CK5/6, CK14 and CK17. The expression of basal cytokeratin markers CK5/6 in breast carcinomas has been associated with high histological grade and poor clinical outcome. A previous study has shown that CK5/6 can be detected in up to 17% of invasive lobular carcinomas (ILC). Here we study the expression of three basal cytokeratin markers (CK5/6, CK14, and CK17) in 53 ILC cases diagnosed by histology and lack of E-cadherin expression. Among them, 42 were classic lobular carcinomas, 6 were tubular-lobular carcinoma, and 5 were pleomorphic lobular carcinomas. There was no significant difference among these three groups in patients' age, tumor size, uni- and multi-focality, expression of ER and PR, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion and lymph node metastasis. The only statistically different factor was HER2 over-expression, which was observed only in pleomorphic ILC (P = 0.0073). None of the 53 cases expressed CK5/6, CK14 or CK17; and 51/53 cases expressed luminal markers CK8 and CK18, and the two negative cases were both classic lobular carcinoma, with positivity for ER and PR. In conclusion, all 53 cases of ILC failed to show expression by any of the three basal CK markers, suggesting that very few ILC will demonstrate a basal phenotype when assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). More studies are needed to investigate molecular classification in lobular carcinoma of the breast.
Cytomegalovirus Expresses the Chemokine Homologue vXCL1 Capable of Attracting XCR1+ CD4- Dendritic Cells. Cytomegaloviruses (CMV) have developed various strategies to escape the immune system of the host. One strategy involves the expression of virus-encoded chemokines to modulate the host chemokine network. We have identified in the English isolate of rat CMV (murid herpesvirus 8 [MuHV8]) an open reading frame encoding a protein homologous to the chemokineXCL1, the only known C chemokine. Viral XCL1 (vXCL1), a glycosylated protein of 96 amino acids, can be detected 13 h postinfection in the supernatant of MuHV8-infected rat embryo fibroblasts. vXCL1 exclusively binds to CD4- rat dendritic cells (DC), a subset of DC that express the corresponding chemokine receptor XCR1. Like endogenous rat XCL1, vXCL1 selectively chemoattracts XCR1+ CD4- DC. Since XCR1+ DC in mice and humans have been shown to excel in antigen cross-presentation and thus in the induction of cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes, the virus has apparently hijacked this gene to subvert cytotoxic immune responses. The biology of vXCL1 offers an interesting opportunity to study the role of XCL1 and XCR1+ DC in the cross-presentation of viral antigens.
Mesenchymal stem cells inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory responses of BV2 microglial cells through TSG-6. Microglia are the primary immunocompetent cells in brain tissue and microglia-mediated inflammation is associated with the pathogenesis of various neuronal disorders. Recently, many studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) display a remarkable ability to modulate inflammatory and immune responses through the release of a variety of bioactive molecules, thereby protecting the central nervous system. Previously, we reported that MSCs have the ability to modulate inflammatory responses in a traumatic brain injury model and that the potential mechanisms may be partially attributed to upregulated TNF-α stimulated gene/protein 6 (TSG-6) expression. However, whether TSG-6 exerts an anti-inflammatory effect by affecting microglia is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs and TSG-6 in an in vitro lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV2 microglial activation model. We found that MSCs and TSG-6 significantly inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in activated microglia. However, MSC effects on microglia were attenuated when TSG-6 expression was silenced. In addition, we found that the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells was significantly inhibited by TSG-6. Furthermore, we found that the presence of CD44 in BV2 microglial cells was essential for MSC- and TSG-6-mediated inhibition of pro-inflammatory gene expression and of NF-κB and MAPK activation in BV2 microglial cells. The results of this study suggest that MSCs can modulate microglia activation through TSG-6 and that TSG-6 attenuates the inflammatory cascade in activated microglia. Our study indicates that novel mechanisms are responsible for the immunomodulatory effect of MSCs on microglia and that MSCs, as well as TSG-6, might be promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of neurotraumatic injuries or neuroinflammatory diseases associated with microglial activation.
The glutamate/neutral amino acid transporter family SLC1: Molecular, physiological and pharmacological aspects. The solute carrier family 1 (SLC1) includes five high-affinity glutamate transporters, EAAC1, GLT-1, GLAST, EAAT4 and EAAT5 (SLC1A1, SLC1A2, SLC1A3, SLC1A6, and SLC1A7, respectively) as well as the two neutral amino acid transporters, ASCT1 and ASCT2 (SLC1A4 and ALC1A5, respectively). Although each of these transporters have similar predicted structures, they exhibit distinct functional properties which are variations of a common transport mechanism. The high-affinity glutamate transporters mediate transport of L-Glu, L-Asp and D-Asp, accompanied by the cotransport of 3 Na+ and 1 H+, and the countertransport of 1 K+, whereas ASC transporters mediate Na+-dependent exchange of small neutral amino acids such as Ala, Ser, Cys and Thr. The unique coupling of the glutamate transporters allows uphill transport of glutamate into cells against a concentration gradient. This feature plays a crucial role in protecting neurons against glutamate excitotoxicity in the central nervous system. During pathological conditions, such as brain ischemia (e.g. after a stroke), however, glutamate exit can occur due to "reversed glutamate transport", which is caused by a reversal of the electrochemical gradients of the coupling ions. Selective inhibition of the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1 (SLC1A1) may be of therapeutic interest to block glutamate release from neurons during ischemia. On the other hand, upregulation of the glial glutamate transporter GLT1 (SLC1A2) may help protect motor neurons in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), since loss of function of GLT1 has been associated with the pathogenesis of certain forms of ALS.
Identification and Validation of lncRNA-AC087588.2 in Lung Adenocarcinoma: A Novel Prognostic and Diagnostic Indicator. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common histological lung cancer, and it is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in the initiation and progression of various cancers. LncRNA-AC087588.2 (ENSG00000274976) is a novel lncRNA that is abnormally expressed in diverse cancer types, including LUAD. However, the clinical significance, prognostic value, diagnostic value, immune role, and the potential biological function of AC087588.2 LUAD remain elusive. In this study, we found that AC087588.2 was upregulated and associated with a poor prognosis in LUAD. In addition, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that AC087588.2 could be an independent prognostic factor for LUAD. Functionally, the knockdown of AC087588.2 restrained LUAD cell proliferation and migration in vitro. Finally, we constructed a ceRNA network that included hsa-miR-30a-5p and four mRNAs (ANLN, POLR3G, EHBP1, and ERO1A) specific to AC087588.2 in LUAD. The Kaplan–Meier survival analysis showed that lower expression of hsa-miR-30a-5p and higher expression of ANLN, POLR3G, EHBP1, and ERO1A were associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with LUAD. This finding provided a comprehensive view of the AC087588.2-mediated ceRNA network in LUAD, thereby highlighting its potential role in the diagnosis and prognosis of LUAD.
Development of Cell-Penetrating Asymmetric Interfering RNA Targeting Connective Tissue Growth Factor. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a multifunctional matricellular protein, playing a role as a central mediator in tissue remodeling and fibrosis. A number of reports have shown the pivotal roles of CTGF in the progression of fibrosis, suggesting CTGF as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of fibrotic disorders including hypertrophic scars and keloids. In this study, we present the development of an interfering RNA molecule that efficiently inhibits the expression of CTGF via RNA interference mechanism both in\xa0vitro and in\xa0vivo. Chemical modifications were introduced to the asymmetric interfering RNA (asiRNA) backbone structure. The resulting RNA molecule, termed cell-penetrating asiRNA (cp-asiRNA), entered into cells and triggered RNA interference-mediated gene silencing without delivery vehicles. The gene-silencing activity of cp-asiRNA targeting CTGF (cp-asiCTGF) was examined both in\xa0vitro and in\xa0vivo. Furthermore, the administration of cp-asiCTGF in the rat skin excision wound model efficiently reduced the induction of CTGF and collagens during the wound-healing process. These results suggest that the cp-asiCTGF molecule could be developed into antifibrotic therapeutics such as antiscar drugs.
Association of APOE with primary open-angle glaucoma suggests a protective effect for APOE ε4. PURPOSE. Prior studies have demonstrated that microglial activation is involved in the pathogenesis of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Here we sought to identify genetic associations between POAG and variants in APOE and TREM2, genes associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) that critically regulate microglial neurodegeneration-associated molecular signature. METHODS. APOE genotypes were called using imputed data from the NEIGHBOR consortium (2120 POAG cases, 2262 controls) and a second cohort from the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI; 486 cases, 344 controls). TREM2 coding variants were genotyped by means of the Illumina HumanExome BeadArray. The data set was analyzed for association with POAG overall, as well as the high-tension glaucoma (HTG) and normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) subgroups, using logistic regression adjusting for age and sex. RESULTS. In the combined NEIGHBOR-MEEI data set, significant association was observed for APOE ε4 in POAG overall (odds ratio [OR], 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74–0.94; P = 0.0022) and in both the HTG subgroup (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70–0.94; P = 0.0052) and NTG subgroup (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58–0.87; P = 0.0014). A rare TREM2 variant (A105V) was found only in HTG cases (3 of 2863 cases) and in none of the controls (P = 0.03). Three TREM2 rare variants associated with AD were not significantly associated with POAG (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. We have found that the APOE ε4 allele is associated with a reduced risk of POAG. Interestingly, the same allele is adversely associated with AD, suggesting a mechanistic difference between neurodegenerative diseases of the eye and the brain. TREM2 variants associated with AD did not significantly contribute to POAG risk.
B complex vitamins activate rat guanylate cyclase and increase cyclic GMP levels. Abstract. Since B complex vitamins and the intracellular messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) have similar effects of promoting growth, DNA and protein synthesis, the present investigation was designed to determine if the B complex vitamins' mechanism of action might involve cyclic GMP. All of the B complex vitamins increased rat cyclic GMP tissue levels. The cause of these increased cyclic GMP levels was activation of the enzyme guanylate cyclase [E.C.4.6.1.2.] which was increased significantly (P<0·001) in a variety of tissues at the 1 nmol 1‐1 concentration of these vitamins. The maximal activation of this enzyme required the presence of manganese ion. The present investigation suggests that the guanylate cyclase‐cyclic GMP system may play a role in the mechanism of action of B complex vitamins at the cellular level.
'DISC1 (Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia 1) is a centrosome-associated protein that interacts with MAP1A, MIPT3, ATF4/5 and NUDEL: Regulation and loss of interaction with mutation. Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) is a novel gene associated with schizophrenia by multiple genetic studies. In order to determine how mutations in DISC1 might cause susceptibility to schizophrenia, we undertook a comprehensive study of the cellular biology of DISC1 in its full-length and disease-associated mutant forms. DISC1 interacts by yeast two-hybrid, mammalian two-hybrid, and co-immunoprecipitation assays with multiple proteins of the centrosome and cytoskeletal system, including MIPT3, MAP1A and NUDEL; proteins which localize receptors to membranes, including α-actinin2 and β4-spectrin; and proteins which transduce signals from membrane receptors, including ATF4 and ATF5. Truncated mutant DISC1 fails to interact with ATF4, ATF5 or NUDEL. Deletion mapping demonstrated that DISC1 has distinct interaction domains: MAP1A interacts via its LC2 domain with the N-terminus of DISC1, whereas MIPT3 and NUDEL bind via their C-terminal domains to the central coiled-coil domain of DISC1, and ATF4/5 bind via their C-terminal domains to the C-terminus of DISC1. In its full-length form, DISC1 protein localizes to predominantly perinuclear punctate structures which extend into neurites in some cells; mutant truncated DISC1, by contrast, is seen in a diffuse pattern throughout the cytoplasm and abundantly in neurites. Both forms co-localize with the centrosomal complex, although truncated less abundantly than full-length DISC1. Although both full-length and mutant DISC1 are found in microtubule fractions, neither form of DISC1 appears to bind directly to microtubules, but rather do so in a MIPT3-dependent fashion that is stabilized by taxol. Based on these data, we propose that DISC1 is a multifunctional protein whose truncation contributes to schizophrenia susceptibility by disrupting intracellular transport, neurite architecture and/or neuronal migration, all of which have been hypothesized to be pathogenic in the schizophrenic brain.
'Role of subnano-, nano- and submicron-surface features on osteoblast differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Subnano, nano and sub-micron surface features can selectively activate integrin receptors and induce osteoblast differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Although it is widely accepted that nanoscale titanium surface roughness may promote differentiation of various osteoblast lineages, there has been no clear report on the threshold dimension of surface features and the optimized dimensions of surface features for triggering integrin activation and stem cell differentiation. This study systematically controlled titanium surface features from the sub-nano to sub-micron scales and investigated the corresponding effects on stem cell responses, such as integrin activation, cyclins, key transcriptional genes of osteoblast differentiation and osteoblastic phenotype genes. Surface features with sub-nano surface dimensions were insufficient to increase integrin activation compared to pure nanoscale titanium surface features. Although both pure nanoscale and nano-submicron hybrid scales of titanium surface features were sufficient for activating integrin-ligand proteins interactions through the α integrin subunits, only nano-submicron hybrid titanium surface features significantly accelerated subsequent osteoblast differentiation of primary mouse bone marrow stromal cells after 2 weeks. In addition, live cell analysis of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells on transparent titanium demonstrated rapid cytoskeletal re-organization on the nanoscale surface features, which ultimately induced higher expression of osteoblast phenotype genes after 3 weeks.
Set1/COMPASS and mediator are repurposed to promote epigenetic transcriptional memory. In yeast and humans, previous experiences can lead to epigenetic transcriptional memory: repressed genes that exhibit mitotically heritable changes in chromatin structure and promoter recruitment of poised RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex (RNAPII PIC), which enhances future reactivation. Here, we show that INO1 memory in yeast is initiated by binding of the Sfl1 transcription factor to the cis-acting Memory Recruitment Sequence, targeting INO1 to the nuclear periphery. Memory requires a remodeled form of the Set1/COMPASS methyltransferase lacking Spp1, which dimethylates histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2). H3K4me2 recruits the SET3C complex, which plays an essential role in maintaining this mark. Finally, while active INO1 is associated with Cdk8- Mediator, during memory, Cdk8+ Mediator recruits poised RNAPII PIC lacking the Kin28 CTD kinase. Aspects of this mechanism are generalizable to yeast and conserved in human cells. Thus, COMPASS and Mediator are repurposed to promote epigenetic transcriptional poising by a highly conserved mechanism.
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 mutation as a causative and susceptibility gene in parkinsonism. Objective: To investigate the role of spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) in the development of parkinsonism. Method: We screened 1,155 parkinsonian patients (931 with Parkinson disease and 224 with multiple system atrophy) and 400 normal subjects for SCA17. 99mTc-TR0DAT-l SPECT was used to evaluate the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) status. Results: Trinucleotide expansion in the SCA17 gene was found in 10 parkinsonian patients (8 with Parkinson disease, 2 with multiple system atrophy) using 42 repeats as an upper normal limit. The repeat sizes in the patients ranged from 43 to 46, which are considered to be low-range expansions. All patients had interrupted sequences. Three probands and three asymptomatic carriers underwent 99mTc-TR0DAT-1 SPECT. Striatal DAT binding was markedly reduced in all probands and mildly decreased in one asymptomatic carrier. Among the 400 normal control subjects, there was one individual with an expansion of 44 repeats, another with 43 repeats, and two with 42 repeats. Striatal DAT binding was decreased not only in the control subjects with 44 or 43 repeats, but in ones with 42 repeats, suggesting that an expansion as low as 42 repeats might constitute a susceptibility gene for parkinsonism. Conclusions: Low-range expansion of the SCA17 gene is not a rare genetic cause of parkinsonism without ataxia in our population. Reduced penetrance or variable expressivity in low-range expansion might be an explanation for the blurred cutoff point for normal expansion in SCA17.
Emergence of infectious simian virus 40 whose AT tract in the replication origin/early promoter region is substituted by cellular or viral DNAs. In simian virus 40 (SV40) and several other polyomaviruses, the TATA box of the early promoter is embedded in an AT tract that is also an essential part of the replication origin. We generated an ‘AT trap’, an SV40 genome lacking the AT tract and unable to grow in CV-1 monkey cells. Cotransfection of the AT trap with oligonucleotides containing AT tracts of human polyomaviruses, a poly(A : T) tract or variants of the SV40 WT sequence all restored infectious virus. In a transfection of the AT trap without a suitable oligonucleotide, an AT-rich segment was incorporated, stemming either from bovine (calf serum) or monkey (host cell) DNA. Similarly, when cells were grown with human serum, a human DNA segment was captured by SV40 to substitute for the missing AT stretch. We conclude that the virus is quite opportunistic in accepting heterologous substitutes, and that even low-abundance DNA from serum can be incorporated into the viral genome.
Identification of a WT1 protein-derived peptide, WT1187, as a HLA-A*0206-restricted, WT1-specific CTL epitope. The Wilms' tumor gene WT1 is overexpressed in various kinds of hematopoietic malignancies as well as solid cancers, and this protein has been demonstrated to be an attractive target antigen for cancer immunotherapy. WT1-specific CTL epitopeswith a restriction of HLA-A*2402 or HLA-A*0201 have been already identified. In the present study it has been demonstrated that a 9-mer WT1-derived WT1187 peptide, which had already been shown to elicit a WT1-specific CTL response with a restriction of HLA-A*0201, can also elicit a CTL response with a restriction of HLA-A*0206. In all three different HLA-A*0206+ healthy donors examined, WT1187 peptide-specific CTL could be generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the CTL showed cytotoxic activity that depended on dual expression of WT1 and HLA-A*0206 molecules. The present study describes the first identification of a HLA-A*0206-restricted, WT1-specific CTL epitope. The present results should help to broaden the application of WT1 peptide-based immunotherapy fromonly HLA-A*0201- positive to HLA-A*0206-positive cancer patients as well.
Contribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 to familial ovarian cancer: A gynecologic oncology group study. Objectives. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations among ovarian cancer patients ascertained to have a family history of ovarian cancer. Methods. Ovarian cancer patients were eligible if they had a family history of cancer that met any one of the following criteria: (1) a first-degree relative with ovarian cancer; (2) a second-degree relative with ovarian cancer plus a first-degree relative with breast cancer (diagnosed younger than 50 years of age); or (3) a first- and a second-degree relative with breast cancer (diagnosed younger than 50 years of age). The entire coding sequence of BRCA1 and exon 11 of BRCA2 were screened for germline alterations by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Results. Of 26 eligible patients screened for mutations, 12 had deleterious alterations, 8 in BRCA1 and 4 in BRCA2. A correlation was noted between the presence of a BRCA1 mutation and the strength of family history of breast ovarian cancer, with the likelihood of a mutation increasing with the number of affected relatives (P = 0.0002). No association was detected between the location of mutations in BRCA1 and the ratio of ovarian cancer cases relative to breast cancer (P = 0.28). Conclusions. Mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are present in about 50% of ovarian cancer patients with at least one first-degree relative with disease, and in 70% of patients with two or more relatives with ovarian cancer.
'MicroRNAs regulate distal region of mandibular development through Hh signaling. Mandibular anomalies are often seen in various congenital diseases, indicating that mandibular development is under strict molecular control. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in mandibular development. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding small single-stranded RNAs that play a critical role in regulating the level of gene expression. We found that the mesenchymal conditional deletion of miRNAs arising from a lack of Dicer (an essential molecule for miRNA processing, Dicerfl/fl;Wnt1Cre), led to an abnormal groove formation at the distal end of developing mandibles. At E10.5, when the region forms, inhibitors of Hh signaling, Ptch1 and Hhip1 showed increased expression at the region in Dicer mutant mandibles, while Gli1 (a major mediator of Hh signaling) was significantly downregulated in mutant mandibles. These suggest that Hh signaling was downregulated at the distal end of Dicer mutant mandibles by increased inhibitors. To understand whether the abnormal groove formation inDicer mutant mandibles was caused by the downregulation of Hh signaling, mice with a mesenchymal deletion of Hh signaling activity arising from a lack of Smo (an essential molecule for Hh signaling activation, Smofl/fl;Wnt1Cre) were examined. Smofl/fl;Wnt1Cre mice showed a similar phenotype in the distal region of their mandibles to those in Dicerfl/fl;Wnt1Cre mice. We also found that approximately 400 miRNAs were expressed in wild-type mandibular mesenchymes at E10.5, and six microRNAs were identified as miRNAs with binding potential against both Ptch1 and Hhip1. Their expressions at the distal end of the mandible were confirmed by in situ hybridization. This indicates that microRNAs regulate the distal part of mandibular formation at an early stage of development by involving Hh signaling activity through controlling its inhibitor expression level.
Genetic and pharmacological targeting of A2a receptor improves function of anti-mesothelin CAR T cells. Background: CAR T cell-based therapies have shown promising results in hematological malignancies. Results of CAR T cell projects in solid tumors have been less impressive, and factors including lack of targetable antigens and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) have been suggested as culprits. Adenosine, a metabolite which is highly produced in TME, is known to mediate the suppression of anti-tumor T cell responses via binding and signaling through adenosine 2a receptor (A2aR). Methods: In this study, the expression of A2aR and the effects of its activation on the function of fully human anti-mesothelin CAR T cells (MSLN-CAR T), were analyzed. Afterwards, the molecular and pharmacological means to overcome the inhibitory effects of A2aR signaling on CAR T cell function were used. This was performed by targeting A2aR expression in MSLN-CAR T cells using various anti-A2aR shRNA sequences embedded in the CAR vector and an A2aR pharmacological antagonist, SCH-58261. Statistical analyses were performed Prism 7 software. Results: Our experiments showed significant A2aR upregulation on T cells during the CAR T cell production procedure (cell activation and transduction). Activation of adenosine signaling using adenosine analog led to the suppression of all major anti-tumor functions in MSLN-CAR T cells. Interestingly, CAR T cells that carried the anti-A2aR shRNA sequences were resistant to the inhibitory effects of adenosine signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of A2aR reversed the reduction in CAR T cell proliferation and cytokine response caused by the adenosine analog; however, it failed to rescue the cytotoxic function of the cells. Conclusion: Altogether, our results indicate that mitigating A2aR signaling by genetic targeting of the receptor might be a promising approach in improving CAR T cell function in an unreceptive microenvironment and could potentially improve the outcome of treatment in clinical settings.
Impaired mitotic progression and preimplantation lethality in mice lacking OMCG1, a new evolutionarily conserved nuclear protein. While highly conserved through evolution, the cell cycle has been extensively modified to adapt to new developmental programs. Recently, analyses of mouse mutants revealed that several important cell cycle regulators are either dispensable for development or have a tissue- or cell-type-specific function, indicating that many aspects of cell cycle regulation during mammalian embryo development remain to be elucidated. Here, we report on the characterization of a new gene, Omcg1, which codes for a nuclear zinc finger protein. Embryos lacking Omcg1 die by the end of preimplantation development. In vitro cultured Omcg1-null blastocysts exhibit a dramatic reduction in the total cell number, a high mitotic index, and the presence of abnormal mitotic figures. Importantly, we found that Omcg1 disruption results in the lengthening of M phase rather than in a mitotic block. We show that the mitotic delay in Omcg1-/- embryos is associated with neither a dysfunction of the spindle checkpoint nor abnormal global histone modifications. Taken together, these results suggest that Omcg1 is an important regulator of the cell cycle in the preimplantation embryo.
Association of serum IFN-λ3 with inflammatory and fibrosis markers in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the major causes of liver cancer. The single nucleotide polymorphisms within the IFNL3 gene, which encodes interferon (IFN)-λ3, are strongly associated with the response to pegylated IFN-α (PEG-IFN-α) plus ribavirin (RBV) therapy in chronic hepatitis C (C-CH) patients. However, the roles of IFN-λ3 in chronic HCV infection are still elusive. In this study, we aimed to identify clinical and immunological factors influencing IFN-λ3 and evaluated whether serum IFN-λ3 levels are involved or not involved in the response to PEG-IFN-α plus RBV therapy. Methods: We enrolled 119 C-CH patients with HCV genotype 1 infection who underwent 48\xa0weeks of PEG-IFN-α plus RBV therapy. As controls, 23 healthy subjects and 56 patients with non-HCV viral hepatitis were examined. Serum IFN-λ3 was quantified by chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay, and 27 cytokines or chemokines were assayed by the multiplexed BioPlex system. Results: Serum IFN-λ3 levels were higher in C-CH patients or acute hepatitis E patients than in healthy volunteers. Such levels did not differ between the IFNL3 genotypes. In C-CH patients, serum IFN-λ3 was positively correlated with aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, α-fetoprotein, histological activity, fibrosis index, IFN-γ-inducible protein 10, and platelet-derived growth factor. Multivariate analysis showed that IFNL3 single nucleotide polymorphisms, fibrosis score, and macrophage inflammatory protein\xa01α were involved in the sustained viral clearance in PEG-IFN-α plus RBV therapy; however, serum IFN-λ3 levels were not involved. Conclusion: Serum IFN-λ3 levels are increased in C-CH patients regardless of the IFNL3 genotype. IFN-λ3 is a biomarker reflecting the activity and fibrosis of liver disease, but is not correlated with the responsiveness to PEG-IFN-α plus RBV therapy.
Promoter methylation and expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 gene in gastric cancer. AIM: To analyze the relations among the aberrant methylation of the promoter CpG islands of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) gene, its protein expression, and the clinicopathological features of gastric adenocarcinoma. METHODS: The methylation status of promoter CpG islands and protein expression of TIMP3 gene in the tumors and the adjacent normal mucosal tissues of 78 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma were detected by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and immunohistochemistry respectively. RESULTS: The CpG island methylation of TIMP3 was detected in tumour tissues, cancer-adjacent tissues and lymph node with metastasis. In increasing order of frequency, the hypermethylation rates of these tissues were 35.9% (28 of 78 non-neoplastic tissues), 85% (17 of 20 early-stage cases), 89.7% (52 of 58 progression-stage cases), and 100% (78 of 78 metabasis lymph node), respectively, and there was marked difference between cancerous and non-cancerous tissues (P < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences among subgroups of tumor tissues (P > 0.05). Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed TIMP3 down-regulation in tumur tissues. The rate of TIMP3 gene expression in non-neoplastic tissues was 100%, while in tumour tissues, it decreased dramatically: in early-stage cancer, it decreased to 30% (6/20); in progression stage, it was 3.4% (2/58); and in metabasis lymph node, it was 0% (0/78). Of 70 tumor tissues with negative TIMP3 expression, 64 (91.4%) were hypermethylated and 6 (8.6%) were unmethylated, indicating that there were significant association between hypermethylation and reduced or negative TIMP3 expression (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The hypermethylation of promoter region in CpG islands is a main mechanism of reduced and loss expression of TIMP3 gene, and it may provide an evidence for molecular diagnosis and stage evaluation of gastric cancer.
Suppressor of cytokine signaling-2: A growth hormone-inducible inhibitor of intestinal epithelial cell proliferation. Background & Aims: Growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) increase intestinal growth. GH is thought to act indirectly via IGF-I. In several models, including rats given total parenteral nutrition (TPN), IGF-I more potently stimulates mucosal growth than GH, even when GH induces similar circulating IGF-I levels. These studies test the hypothesis that GH induces a suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS), which inhibits intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) proliferation. Methods: Rats on TPN received vehicle, GH, or IGF-I. Jejunal SOCS (SOCS-1, -2, -3, and cytokine-inducible SH2-domain-containing protein [CIS]) and IGF-I messenger RNA (mRNA) were quantified. Caco-2, IEC-6 cells, and SOCS-2 null and wild-type (WT) mice were used to examine the expression and functional role of SOCS-2. Results: As reported previously, IGF-I, but not GH, prevented mucosal atrophy during TPN, although GH elevated plasma IGF-I and increased body weight. GH, but not IGF-I, induced jejunal SOCS-2 mRNA. SOCS-2 mRNA levels in GH and IGF-I-treated rats inversely correlated with mucosal weight. SOCS-2 is expressed in Caco-2 cells, and elevated SOCS-2 expression in postconfluent cells is associated with reduced proliferative rates. SOCS-2 overexpression in Caco-2 cells inhibited cell proliferation and promoted differentiation. In IEC-6 cells, GH induced SOCS-2 and reduced basal or IGF-I-induced proliferation. GH also reduced proliferative activity in isolated crypts from WT but not SOCS-2 null mice, and SOCS-2 null crypts showed enhanced proliferative responses to GH and IGF-I. SOCS-2 null mice have increased intestinal weight and length. Conclusions: SOCS-2 is a GH-inducible, novel inhibitor of intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and intestinal growth.
'Mitotic chromosomes are compacted laterally by KIF4 and condensin and axially by topoisomerase IIα. Mitotic chromosome formation involves a relatively minor condensation of the chromatin volume coupled with a dramatic reorganization into the characteristic "X" shape. Here we report results of a detailed morphological analysis, which revealed that chromokinesin KIF4 cooperated in a parallel pathway with condensin complexes to promote the lateral compaction of chromatid arms. In this analysis, KIF4 and condensin were mutually dependent for their dynamic localization on the chromatid axes. Depletion of either caused sister chromatids to expand and compromised the "intrinsic structure" of the chromosomes (defined in an in vitro assay), with loss of condensin showing stronger effects. Simultaneous depletion of KIF4 and condensin caused complete loss of chromosome morphology. In these experiments,topoisomerase II? contributed to shaping mitotic chromosomes by promoting the shortening of the chromatid axes and apparently acting in opposition to the actions of KIF4 and condensins. These three proteins are major determinants in shaping the characteristic mitotic chromosome morphology.
Functional AP1 and CRE response elements in the human keratinocyte transglutaminase promoter mediating Whn suppression. Expression of keratinocyte transglutaminase (TGM1) is critical for maturation of mammalian epidermis and occurs during squamous metaplasia. Examination of the TGM1 5'-flanking region in transient transfections of human epidermal cells revealed an AP1 site ≃ 1.5 kb upstream from the transcription start site and a CRE site ≃ 0.5 kb upstream that, combined, accounted for as much as 90% of the transcriptional activity. Upon incubation with nuclear extract, three electrophoretically separable protein complexes were formed by a CRE site oligonucleotide, one of which was competed by an AP1 response element. In super-shift analysis, c-Jun and JunD formed complexes with both the AP1 and CRE sequences. The AP1 and CRE sites were found to mediate the suppressive effects of the Whn transcription factor on the activity of the TGM1 promoter. Similarly, two previously described AP1 sites mediated Whn suppression of involucrin promoter activity.
CXCR4 overexpression is associated with poor outcome in females diagnosed with Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Background: It has been proposed that the chemokine receptor, CXCR4, and its ligand, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), play a critical role in organ-specific tumor metastasis. High CXCR4 expression in resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors is associated with poorer outcome; however, its effect on patient outcome in advanced NSCLC has not been explored. Methods: After institutional ethical approval was obtained, demographic details, clinical variables, and outcome data were collected on consecutive NSCLC patients diagnosed at the Tom Baker Cancer Centre from 2003 to 2006 (Glans-Look Lung Cancer Database). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded diagnostic biopsies from stage IV patients were obtained and tissue microarrays generated. CXCR4 expression within NSCLC cells was analyzed by quantitative fluorescent immunohistochemistry using the HistoRx PM-2000 platform and then correlated with clinical outcome. Results: Of 832 patients, 170 had samples suitable for tissue microarray generation and analysis. Automated immunohistochemistry for CXCR4 was successfully completed on all 170 patients. High expressors had a significantly poorer median overall survival of 2.7 months versus 5.6 months for the low expressors (p = 0.0468). This difference is driven by high-expressing females who have a median overall survival of 1.6 months versus 6.4 months for the low expressors (p = 0.006). Conclusions: CXCR4 is expressed in the majority of NSCLC tumors, and overexpression is associated with significantly poorer survival in stage IV NSCLC patients. Interestingly, this poor outcome is disproportionately represented in the female population. Our results suggest a gender-dependent difference in clinical outcome based on CXCR4 overexpression in stage IV NSCLC.
'Canine SOD1 harboring E40K or T18S mutations promotes protein aggregation without reducing the global structural stability. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease associated with aggregation of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein. More than 160 mutations in human SOD1 have been identified in familial ALS and extensively characterized in previous studies. Here, we investigated the effects of T18S and E40K mutations on protein aggregation of canine SOD1. These two mutations are exclusively found in canine degenerative myelopathy (an ALS-like neurodegenerative disease in dogs), whose phenotype is unknown at the level of protein folding. Interestingly, the T18S and E40K mutations did not alter far-UV CD spectrum, enzymatic activity, or global structural stability of canine SOD1. However, thioflavin-T assay and transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that these mutations promote formation of fibrous aggregates, in particular in the Cu2+/Zn2+-unbound state. These evidence suggested that the T18S and E40K mutations promote protein aggregation through a unique mechanism, possibly involving destabilization of the local structure, reduction of net negative charge, or production of disulfide-linked oligomers.
Inflammation as cause for scar cancers of the lung. The molecular and cellular basis of inflammation has become a topic of great interest of late because of the association between mechanisms of inflammation and risk for cancer. Inflammatory-mediated events, such as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the activation of growth factors (for wound repair), and the altering of signal-transduction processes to activate cell-proliferation (to replace necrotic/apoptotic tissue cells), events that also can occur independently of inflammation, are all considered to be components of risk for a variety of cancers. Using scar cancer of the lung as an example, mechanisms of inflammation associated with recurring infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis are discussed in the context that they may, in fact, be the major or sole cause of a cancer. Production of ROS, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and cytokines in pulmonary tissues is greatly enhanced due to a cell-mediated immune response against macrophages infected with M. tuberculosis. These responses lead to the extensive fibrosis associated with recurring infections, possibly leading to decreased clearance of lymph and lymph-associated particles from the infected region. They also will enhance rates of cell division by inhibiting synthesis of P21, leading to enhanced progression from G0 arrest to G1 phase, from G1 to S phase, and from G2 to M phase of the cell cycle. By increasing rates of oxidative DNA damage and inhibiting apoptosis by enhancing synthesis of BCL-2, mutagenesis of progeny cells is enhanced, and these effects coupled with enhanced angiogenesis stimulated by COX-2 products lead to an environment that is highly conducive to tumorigenesis. Based on the evidence, it appears that but for an inflammatory response to recurring infections, some cases of scar cancer would not exist. By making appropriate lifestyle and dietary changes, a variety of anti-inflammatory effects can be produced, which should attenuate inflammation-induced risk for cancer.
Heparin fragments induce cervical inflammation by recruiting immune cells through Toll-like receptor 4 in nonpregnant mice. Inflammation is a hallmark in the human cervix remodelling. A possible candidate inducing the inflammatory driven ripening of the cervix is the matrix component heparan sulphate, which has been shown to be elevated in late pregnancy in the cervix and uterus. Heparin and a glycol-split low molecular weight heparin (gsHep) with low anticoagulant potency has been shown to enhance myometrial contraction and interleukin (IL)-8 production by cervical fibroblasts. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which heparin promotes cervical inflammation. Wild-type, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-deficient mice were treated by deposition of gsHep into the vaginas of nonpregnant mice. To identify which cells that responded to the heparin fragments, a rhodamine fluorescent construct of gsHep was used, which initially did bind to the epithelial cells and were at later time points located in the sub-mucosa. The heparin fragments induced a strong local inflammatory response in wild-type mice shown by a rapid infiltration of neutrophils and to a lesser extent macrophages into the epithelium and the underlying extracellular matrix of the cervix. Further, a marked migration into the cervical and vaginal lumen was seen by both neutrophils and macrophages. The induced mucosal inflammation was strongly reduced in TLR4- and IRF3-deficient mice. In conclusion, our findings suggest that a TLR4/IRF3-mediated innate immune response in the cervical mucosa is induced by gsHep. This low anticoagulant heparin version, a novel TLR4 agonist, could contribute to human cervical ripening during the initiation of labour.
HIF-1α promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bleomycin-induced acute lung injury. The inflammatory response is one of the most important factors in the occurrence and development of acute lung injury (ALI). Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and the NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome have been demonstrated to serve an important role in the pathogenesis of ALI. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether HIF-1α could regulate activation of the NLR P3 inflammasome and its potential function and specific mechanism in bleomycin (BLM)-induced ALI. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and secretion of IL-1β were detected following silencing of HIF-1α or NF-κB, respectively, in BLM-treated A549 and RLE- 6TN cells. The results demonstrated that the NLR P3 inflammasome could be activated after BLM treatment. HIF-1α and NF-κB expression significantly increased in the BLM group. The levels of NF-κB- and NLR P3 inflammasome-associated proteins, including NLR P3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD and caspase-1, markedly decreased after treating A549 and RLE- 6TN cells with HIF-1α small interfering RNA. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome was also inhibited after silencing NF-κB. Furthermore, the levels of IL- 1β markedly decreased in the cellular culture supernatants following inhibition of HIF-1α and NF-κB. Therefore, the present study indicated that HIF-1α could modulate the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the secretion of IL-1β through NF-κB signaling in BLM-induced ALI. The current results improve understanding of the mechanism of ALI and may provide new ideas for identifying therapeutic targets of ALI.
Existence of a Transcription Factor for the Human HMG2 Gene Positively Related to the Level of HMG2 mRNA in the Cells. A functional gene encoding high mobility group 2 (HMG2) protein, which is an abundant eukaryotic DNA-binding protein, has been isolated. The expression of the HMG2 gene is enhanced in exponentially growing cells and in cells transformed with various viral genes and oncogenes. We attempted to identify and characterize the HMG2 gene structure and transcription factor(s) participating in the expression of the gene. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays to characterize the 5'-flanking region of the human HMG2 gene revealed that the nucleotide sequences in two regions are necessary for expression of the HMG2 gene: one (-85 to +44 region) as a core promoter, and the other (-621 to -493 region) as a cis regulatory element(s). Electrophoresis mobility shift assay with a DNA fragment containing the cis regulatory element and a crude nuclear extract from HeLa cells gave several complexes. Chemical footprint and competition assays indicated that the component giving one of the major complexes recognizes a nucleotide sequence of -499 to -486 in the cis regulatory element. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay indicated that the component giving the major complex is required for the effective transcription of the HMG2 gene. The binding component named HMG2TF (HMG2 transcription factor) contained a protein in apparent molecular size of 85 000, as determined by a UV cross-linking experiment. The amount of HMG2TF in the growing cells and transformed cells increased in positive relationship to the level of expression of HMG2 mRNA in the cells. These results suggest that HMG2 gene expression may be regulated by the relative amount of this transcription factor.
PD-L1 and Mismatch Repair Status in Uterine Carcinosarcomas. Uterine carcinosarcomas have few adjuvant treatment options. Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression in these tumors may predict response to checkpoint inhibitor therapies. An increase in PD-L1 expression has been shown in endometrial carcinomas with mismatch repair (MMR) deficiencies; however, few studies have evaluated PD-L1 expression in uterine carcinosarcomas. We examined PD-L1 expression in 41 cases of uterine carcinosarcoma using combined positive scores (CPS) and tumor proportion scores (TPS), and correlated with MMR status, p53 expression, and epithelial histotype. In addition to confirming the diagnosis of carcinosarcoma, the epithelial components were stratified based on endometrioid versus serous histology. Thirty-three cases (80%) were positive for PD-L1, defined as a CPS score of ≥1 or a TPS score of ≥1%. Twelve cases (29%) showed high expression of PD-L1, defined as a CPS score of ≥10 or a TPS score of ≥10%. The majority of the morphologically adjudicated carcinosarcomas had a serous epithelial component (83%) rather than endometrioid (17%), which was reinforced by aberrant p53 staining predominantly within cases with serous morphology. The majority of carcinosarcomas showed at least focal PD-L1 expression, predominantly in tumor-associated immune cells. Carcinosarcomas with endometrioid morphology were significantly more likely to have high-level PD-L1 (5/7 vs. 7/34; P=0.015). MMR-deficient carcinosarcomas were also more likely to have high-level PD-L1 (2/3 vs. 10/28); however, this did not reach statistical significance (P=0.2) and overall MMR-deficiency was uncommon (3 cases, 7%). These findings suggest that PD-L1 may be additive to MMR testing as a predictive biomarker for checkpoint inhibitor vulnerability in carcinosarcomas.
PreDBA: A heterogeneous ensemble approach for predicting protein-DNA binding affinity. The interaction between protein and DNA plays an essential function in various critical natural processes, like DNA replication, transcription, splicing, and repair. Studying the binding affinity of proteins to DNA helps to understand the recognition mechanism of protein-DNA complexes. Since there are still many limitations on the protein-DNA binding affinity data measured by experiments, accurate and reliable calculation methods are necessarily required. So we put forward a computational approach in this paper, called PreDBA, that can forecast protein-DNA binding affinity effectively by using heterogeneous ensemble models. One hundred protein-DNA complexes are manually collected from the related literature as a data set for protein-DNA binding affinity. Then, 52 sequence and structural features are obtained. Based on this, the correlation between these 52 characteristics and protein-DNA binding affinity is calculated. Furthermore, we found that the protein-DNA binding affinity is affected by the DNA molecule structure of the compound. We classify all protein-DNA compounds into five classifications based on the DNA structure related to the proteins that make up the protein-DNA complexes. In each group, a stacked heterogeneous ensemble model is constructed based on the obtained features. In the end, based on the binding affinity data set, we used the leave-one-out cross-validation to evaluate the proposed method comprehensively. In the five categories, the Pearson correlation coefficient values of our recommended method range from 0.735 to 0.926. We have demonstrated the advantages of the proposed method compared to other machine learning methods and currently existing protein-DNA binding affinity prediction approach.
Development of an XBP1 agonist, HLJ2, as a potential therapeutic agent for ulcerative colitis. There is a severe lack of effective treatments for ulcerative colitis (UC), a recurrent and intractable inflammatory bowel disease. The identification of valid targets and new drugs is an urgent need. In this study, we identified the XBP-1 agonist HLJ2 as a promising treatment candidate. In an in vivo mouse model of DSS-induced colitis, HLJ2 decreased weight loss, colon contracture, disease activity index (DAI), colon mucosa damage index (CMDI) and histopathological index (HI). HLJ2 also decreased myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and reduced production of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. HLJ2 improved intestinal mucosa damage induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) and increased the expression of ZO-1 and claudin-1. Fecal 16s rRNA high-throughput sequencing demonstrated a significant improvement in UC intestinal dysbacteriosis in mice treated with HLJ2, including increased abundance of probiotics such as Lachnospiraceae, Prevotellaceae, and Lactobacillaceae. At the same time there was a reduction in the abundance of pathogenic or conditional pathogenic microorganisms such as Bacteroidaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, Deferribacteraceae, and Pseudomonadaceae in HLJ2-treated mice compared with untreated mice. Our results demonstrated that the XBP1 agonist HLJ2 inhibits inflammation, regulates the intestinal flora, and protects the intestinal mucosa. It is thus a potential therapeutic agent for ulcerative colitis.
The Ets family of proteins: weak modulators of gene expression in quest for transcriptional partners.. Members of the Ets family of transcriptional regulators play pivotal roles in physiological processes, such as embryonic development or immune response. The Ets family proteins possess unique regulatory features because they bind DNA as monomers and their respective activities rely more on their ability to interact with other transcription factors than on their specific binding to a cognate DNA sequence. This review focuses on such interactions and also explores dysregulated expression of the Ets proteins in human cancers.
Knockdown of REG Iα Enhances the Sensitivity to 5-Fluorouracil of Colorectal Cancer Cells via Cyclin D1/CDK4 Pathway and BAX/BCL-2 Pathways. Objective: The reverse of chemoresistance and the improvement of sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents of colorectal cancer cells have great clinical significance and the mechanism underlying the drug resistance is still unclear. REG Iα was reported to be upregulated in colorectal cancer tissues, but the roles of chemoresistance are still unclear. Materials and Methods: The expression of REG Iα in colorectal cancer cell lines was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). The expression of REG Iα in HCT116 and LOVO cells was knockdown by siRNA. The cell viability and IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) values were analyzed by the CCK8 assay. The proportion of apoptosis and cell cycles were analyzed by flow cytometry. The migration potency of HCT116 and LOVO cells was analyzed by cell migration assay. The protein level of Cyclin D1, CDK4 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4), Bax and Bcl-2 were analyzed by western blot. Results: Knockdown of REG Iα enhances the sensitivity to 5-Fu of colorectal cancer cells. REG Iα knockdown promoted the cell apoptosis of HCT116 and LOVO under the 5-Fu treatment. The cell migration and cycle of colorectal cancer cells was also inhibited by REG Iα knockdown. We also found that REG Iα knockdown induced cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis by Cyclin D1/CDK4 pathway and BAX/BCL-2 pathways. Conclusions: Knockdown of REG Iα enhances the sensitivity to 5-Fu of colorectal cancer cells via cyclin D1/CDK4 pathway and BAX/BCL-2 pathways.
Selection, transmission, and reversion of an antigen-processing cytotoxic T-lymphocyte escape mutation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. Numerous studies now support that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolution is influenced by immune selection pressure, with population studies showing an association between specific HLA alleles and mutations within defined cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes. Here we combine sequence data and functional studies of CD8 T-cell responses to demonstrate that allele-specific immune pressures also select for mutations flanking CD8 epitopes that impair antigen processing. In persons expressing HLA-A3, we demonstrate consistent selection for a mutation in a C-terminal flanking residue of the normally immunodominant Gag KK9 epitope that prevents its processing and presentation, resulting in a rapid decline in the CD8 T-cell response. This single amino acid substitution also lies within a second HLA-A3-restricted epitope, with the mutation directly impairing recognition by CD8 T cells. Transmission of the mutation to subjects expressing HLA-A3 was shown to prevent the induction of normally immunodominant acute-phase responses to both epitopes. However, subsequent in vivo reversion of the mutation was coincident with delayed induction of new CD8 T-cell responses to both epitopes. These data demonstrate that mutations within the flanking region of an HIV-1 epitope can impair recognition by an established CD8 T-cell response and that transmission of these mutations alters the acute-phase CD8+ T-cell response. Moreover, reversion of these mutations in the absence of the original immune pressure reveals the potential plasticity of immunologically selected evolutionary changes.
Induced transcription results in local changes in chromatin structure, replication timing, and DNA polytenization in a site of intercalary heterochromatin. In salivary gland polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster, the regions of intercalary heterochromatin are characterized by late replication, under-replication, and genetic silencing. Using Gal4/UAS system, we induced transcription of sequences adjacent to transgene insertions in the band 11A6-9. This activation resulted in a loss of "silent" and appearance of "active" epigenetic marks, recruitment of RNA polymerase II, and formation of a puff. The activated region is now early replicating and shows increased level of DNA polytenization. Notably, all these changes are restricted to the area around the inserts, whereas the rest of the band remains inactive and late replicating. Although only a short area near the insertion site is transcribed, it results in an "open" chromatin conformation in a much broader region. We conclude that regions of intercalary heterochromatin do not form stand-alone units of late replication and under-replication. Every part of such regions can be activated and polytenized independently of other parts.
Identification of two human WAVE/SCAR homologues as general actin regulatory molecules which associate with the Arp2/3 complex. WAVE/SCAR protein was identified as a protein which has similarity to WASP and N-WASP, especially in its C terminal. Recently, WAVE/SCAR protein has been shown to cooperate with the Arp2/3 complex, a nucleation core for actin polymerization in vitro. However, in spite of its general function, WAVE/SCAR expression is mainly restricted to the brain, suggesting the existence of related molecule(s). We here identified two human WAVE/SCAR homologues, which cover other organs. We named the original WAVE1 and newly identified ones WAVE2 and WAVE3. WAVE2 had a very wide distribution with strong expression in peripheral blood leukocytes and mapped on chromosome Xp11.21, next to the WASP locus. WAVE3 and WAVE1 had similar distributions. WAVE3 was strongly expressed in brain and mapped on chromosome 13q12. WAVE1 was mapped on chromosome 6q21-22. Ectopically expressed WAVE2 and WAVE3 induced actin filament clusters in a similar manner with WAVE1. These actin cluster formations were suppressed by deletion of their C-terminal VPH (verproline homology)/WH2 (WASP homology 2) domain. Further, WAVE2 and WAVE3 associate with the Arp2/3 complex as does WAVE1. Our identification of WAVE homologues suggests that WAVE family proteins have general function for regulating the actin cytoskeleton in many tissues.
The cardiac actin locus (Actc-1) is not on mouse chromosome 17 but is linked to β2-microglobulin on chromosome 2. A restriction fragment variant and recombinant inbred strains were used to show that the cardiac actin locus (Actc-1) is closely linked to β2-microglobulin (B2m) and several other loci on chromosome 2 of the mouse. Close linkage of Actc-1 and B2m in both man and mouse provides another example of a chromosomal segment that has been conserved since the divergence of the lineages leading to these two species.
Differential effects of transforming growth factor-β2 on corneal endothelial cell proliferation - A role of serum factors. Purpose: To determine the influence of serum on transforming growth factor (TGF)-β2 mediated effects on the proliferation of corneal endothelial cells (CE). Methods: Rat CE were grown in explant culture and the proliferation of CE was measured by [3H]thymidine bioassay. Subconfluent cells were synchronized in the GO (quiescent) phase of the cell cycle by serum starvation for 24 hr. Serum and [3H]thymidine were then added to the cells in the presence or absence of a physiological concentration (5 ng ml-1) of exogenous active TGF-β2. Radioactivity was measured at various time points to detect DNA synthesis. These experiments were repeated without adding serum after serum starvation. Preincubation of exogenous TGF-β2 with neutralizing antibody was used to test the cytokine specificity. Results: Without TGF-β2, a linear increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation, indicating S-phase, began approximately 16 hr after serum addition, then plateaued at approximately 24 hr. Serum promoted DNA synthesis of CE in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of 0.5-10%. In cultures with 10% serum, TGF-β2 (0.5, 1, 5, and 20 ng ml-1) suppressed CE growth dose-dependently. The growth amplitude decreased and the time before S-phase entry, G1 phase, was prolonged to 24 hr. In culture with 1% serum, TGF-β2 (5 ng ml-1) suppressed the CE proliferation by delaying S-phase entry without suppressing growth amplitude. In cultures without serum, TGF-β2 promoted CE growth to a level similar to that of cultures supplemented with 0.5% serum. Conclusions: Responses of cultured CE to exogenous TGF-β2 depended on the concentration of serum in the medium. This result implies a possibility that in vivo serum influx through a compromised bloodocular barrier could influence the CE growth by changing the responses of these cells to TGF-β2 in aqueous humor.
CD40 is functionally expressed on human keratinocytes. The CD40/gp39 pathway is known to be an important feature of B/T cell collaboration leading to T cell-dependent activation, proliferation or differentiation of B cells. Additionally, CD40 is involved in the regulation of B cell survival and apoptosis. Recently, CD40 has been shown to be expressed functionally on nonhematopoietic cells, i.e. endothelial cells. Here, we demonstrate that human keratinocytes (KC) cultured in vitro express CD40 constitutively. The surface expression of CD40 is markedly up-regulated following stimulation with interferon (IFN)-γ, but not with tumor necrosis factor-α or interleukin (IL)-1β. This process is regulated at the CD40 mRNA level as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis. Furthermore, ligation of CD40 via soluble gp39, the CD40 ligand, enhances intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and Bcl-x up-regulation on IFN-γ-stimulated KC, but not lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-3, B7-2, HLA-DR, or Fas expression. The release of IL-8 is also induced following CD40 ligation on KC. In psoriasis, a T-cell-mediated inflammatory skin disease, KC have a markedly enhanced expression of CD40. This expression co-localizes with the expression of ICAM-1, Bcl-x, and an influx of CD3+ T cells. These findings suggest a functional role of CD40 on KC in inflammatory skin disorders such as psoriasis and could make a therapeutic intervention by disrupting the CD40/gp39 pathway an approach to consider in these inflammatory skin diseases.
DDK Has a Primary Role in Processing Stalled Replication Forks to Initiate Downstream Checkpoint Signaling. CDC7-DBF4 kinase (DDK) initiates DNA replication in eukaryotes by activating the replicative MCM helicase. DDK has diverse and apparently conflicting roles in the replication checkpoint response in various organisms, but the underlying mechanisms are far from settled. We show that human DDK promotes limited resection of newly synthesized DNA at stalled replication forks or sites of DNA damage to initiate replication checkpoint signaling. DDK is also required for efficient fork restart and G2/M cell cycle arrest. DDK exhibits genetic interactions with the ssDNA exonuclease EXO1 and phosphorylates EXO1 in vitro. EXO1 is also required for nascent strand degradation following exposure to HU, so DDK might regulate EXO1 directly. Lastly, sublethal DDK inhibition causes various mitotic abnormalities, which is consistent with a checkpoint deficiency. In summary, DDK has a primary and previously undescribed role in the replication checkpoint to promote ssDNA accumulation at stalled forks, which is required to initiate a robust checkpoint response and cell cycle arrest to maintain genome integrity.
YY1 and NF1 both activate the human p53 promoter by alternatively binding to a composite element, and YY1 and E1A cooperate to amplify p53 promoter activity. A novel transcription factor binding element in the human p53 gene promoter has been characterized. It lies about 100 bp upstream of the major reported start site for human p53 gene transcription. On the basis of DNase I footprinting studies, electromobility shift assay patterns, sequence specificity of binding, the binding pattern of purified transcription factors, effects of specific antibodies, and methylation interference analysis we have identified the site as a composite element which can bind both YY1 and NF1 in an independent and mutually exclusive manner. The site is conserved in the human, rat, and mouse p53 promoters. The occupancy of the site varies in a tissue-specific manner. It binds principally YY1 in nuclear extracts of rat testis and spleen and NF1 in extracts of liver and prostate. This may facilitate tissue-specific control of p53 gene expression. When HeLa cells were transiently transfected with human p53 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter constructs, a mutation in this composite element which disabled YY1 and NF1 binding caused a mean 64% reduction in basal p53 promoter activity. From mutations which selectively impaired YY1 or NF1 binding and the overexpression of YY1 or NF1 in HeLa cells we concluded that both YY1 and NF1 function as activators when bound to this site. In transient cotransfections E1A could induce the activity of the p53 promoter to a high level; 12S E1A was threefold as efficient as 13S E1A in this activity, and YY1 bound to the composite element was shown to mediate 55% of this induction. Overexpressed YY1 was shown to be able to synergistically activate the p53 promoter with E1A when not specifically bound to DNA. Deletion of an N-terminal domain of E1A, known to be required for direct E1A-YY1 interaction and E1A effects mediated through transcriptional activator p300, blocked the E1A induction of p53 promoter activity.
p16 expression differentiates high-risk gastrointestinal stromal tumor and predicts poor outcome. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are characterized by alterations in genes involved in cell cycle regulation. Although p16 (INK4A) have been extensively investigated in GISTs, there are still discrepancies regarding its prognostic value. Therefore, we evaluated the clinical occurrence, diagnostic and prognostic value of p16 staining in GIST. One hundred one patients (54 women and 47 men) with a mean age of 64.1 years (range, 17-94 years) were surgically treated for a GIST within a 10-year period. Of these patients, 28 (28%) were affected by metastases (mean follow-up, 4.5 years). In 36 patients (36%), GIST occurred coincidentally with other malignancies. Expression of c-kit was confirmed in 97 GIST patients (96%). In patients with high-risk GIST, the expression of p16 expression was highly predictive for poor prognosis, i.e., the development of recurrence or metastases (P = .006) and poor survival (P = .004). In addition, the expression of p16 was highly predictive for reduction of the survival in patients who were affected by metastases or recurrence (P = .041). The disease-specific and disease-free 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rate was 96%, 90%, and 85% and 81%, 77%, and 72%, respectively. Primary tumor state, tumor size, and high-risk classification were confirmed as relevant predictors for unfavorable prognosis in GIST (P < .001). Our results indicate that in high-risk GIST and in patients with recurrence or metastases, the expression of p16 is highly predictive for poor outcome.
TRIM29 negatively controls antiviral immune response through targeting STING for degradation. Innate immune system is armed by several lines of pattern recognition receptors to sense various viral infection and to initiate antiviral immune response. This process is under a tight control and the negative feedback induced by infection and/or inflammation is critical to maintain immune homoeostasis and to prevent autoimmune disorders, however, the molecular mechanism is not fully understood. Here we report TRIM29, a ubiquitin E3 ligase, functions as an inducible negative regulator of innate immune response triggered by DNA virus and cytosolic DNA. DNA virus and cytosolic DNA stimulation induce TRIM29 expression robustly in macrophages and dendritic cells, although the basal level of TRIM29 is undetectable in those cells. TRIM29 deficiency elevates IFN-I and proinflammatory cytokine production upon viral DNA and cytosolic dsDNA stimulation. Consistently, in vivo experiments show that TRIM29-deficient mice are more resistant to HSV-1 infection than WT controls, indicated by better survival rate and reduced viral load in organs. Mechanism studies suggest that STING-TBK1-IRF3 signaling pathway in TRIM29 KO cells is significantly enhanced and the degradation of STING is impaired. Furthermore, we identify that TRIM29 targets STING for K48 ubiquitination and degradation. This study reveals TRIM29 as a crucial negative regulator in immune response to DNA virus and cytosolic DNA, preventing potential damage caused by overcommitted immune responses.
Simple hemorrhage induces tissue factor mRNA in the liver. Thrombogenic responses are sometimes seen after a large hemorrhage, but the precise mechanisms whereby this phenomenon occurs still remain unknown. We recently showed that plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 rises after a 20- ml/kg hemorrhage in rats and suggested that this change may be one of the contributing factors to the thrombogenic responses after a large hemorrhage. In this study, we set out to detect the changes on the coagulation side, that is, the changes in whole blood clotting time and the mRNA of tissue factor (TF), which is the primary initiator of the clotting cascade. The rats were all bled (20 ml/kg) 3 days after cannulation. The whole blood time was measured by the Lee-White method. Changes in the TF mRNA were detected in the liver by high-performance liquid chromatography after reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction using glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an external standard. A 20-ml/kg hemorrhage significantly shortened the whole blood clotting time and significantly increased the TR mRNA in the liver at 1, 2, and 4h in comparison to the nonhemorrhage controls. These results indicate that a simple hemorrhage without tissue trauma can induce hypercoagulability and suggest that the induction of TF might be involved in this phenomenon.
Molecular basis for SMC rod formation and its dissolution upon DNA binding. SMC condensin complexes are central modulators of chromosome superstructure in all branches of life. Their SMC subunits form a long intramolecular coiled coil, which connects a constitutive "hinge" dimerization domain with an ATP-regulated "head" dimerization module. Here, we address the structural arrangement of the long coiled coils in SMC complexes. We unequivocally show that prokaryotic Smc-ScpAB, eukaryotic condensin, and possibly also cohesin form rod-like structures, with their coiled coils being closely juxtaposed and accurately anchored to the hinge. Upon ATP-induced binding of DNA to the hinge, however, Smc switches to a more open configuration. Our data suggest that a long-distance structural transition is transmitted from the Smc head domains to regulate Smc-ScpAB\'s association with DNA. These findings uncover a conserved architectural theme in SMC complexes, provide a mechanistic basis for Smc\'s dynamic engagement with chromosomes, and offer a molecular explanation for defects in Cornelia de Lange syndrome.
Compound heterozygosity for the C677T and A1298C mutations of the MTHFR gene in a case of hyperhomocysteinemia with recurrent deep thrombosis at young age.. We report a case of a young woman with an extensive, recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) diagnosed by CT scan and duplex ultrasound examination. All blood investigations for etiology of recurrent DVT were normal except for serum homocysteine level, which was mildly increased. No other thrombophilic factors could be found. The three main causes of hyperhomocysteinemia are genetic defects, nutritional deficiencies and insufficient elimination. In our case a genetic defect for one of the key enzymes of homocysteine metabolism was found to be the underlying cause. Oral anticoagulation and supplementation with pyridoxine, cyanocobalamine and folate was recommended. Whether therapy with B vitamins and folate can substantially reduce the recurrence of venous thromboembolic disease remains to be established.
Phosphate excretion and phosphate transporter messenger RNA in uremic rats treated with phosphonoformic acid. The prevention of phosphate retention in chronic renal disease may reduce both renal osteodystrophy and disease progression. We evaluated the expression of the sodium-dependent phosphate transporter, NaPi-2, and the response to phosphonoformic acid (PFA) in rats with 5/6 nephrectomy-induced renal failure. Partial nephrectomy resulted in a significant proteinuria and reduced renal function. In addition, there was an ~50% reduction in the expression of NaPi-2 mRNA. Treatment of rats for 48 hr with PFA (0.6% in glucose drinking fluid) had no effect on NaPi-2 mRNA; however, PFA resulted in a significant increase in fractional phosphate excretion in both normal (7 ± 0.5% vs. 3 ± 0.2%) and uremic (60 ± 4% vs. 36 ± 4%) rats. Plasma phosphate concentration was higher in uremic rats (2.5 ± 0.1 mM) compared with normal rats (1.9 ± 0.04 mM) but not in uremic rats treated with PFA (2.1 ± 0.04 mM). These data suggest that PFA can increase renal phosphate excretion independent of changes in phosphate transporter expression and prevent phosphate retention.
The B29 (immunoglobulin β-chain) gene is a genetic target for early B- cell factor. Early B-cell factor (EBF) is a transcription factor suggested as essential for early B-lymphocyte development by findings in mice where the coding gene has been inactivated by homologous disruption. This makes the identification of genetic targets for this transcription factor pertinent for the understanding of early B-cell development. The lack of B29 transcripts, coding for the β subunit of the B-cell receptor complex, in pro-B cells from EBF-deficient mice suggested that B29 might be a genetic target for EBF. We here present data suggesting that EBF interacts with three independent sites within the mouse B29 promoter. Furthermore, ectopic expression of EBF in HeLa cells activated a B29 promoter-controlled reporter construct 13-fold and induced a low level of expression from the endogenous B29 gene. Finally, mutations in the EBF binding sites diminished B29 promoter activity in pre-B cells while the same mutations did not have as striking an effect on the promoter function in B-cell lines of later differentiation stages. These data suggest that the B29 gene is a genetic target for EBF in early B-cell development.
Rat metallothionein-1 structural gene and three pseudogenes, one of which contains 5'-regulatory sequences. As shown by Southern blot analysis, the metallotionein-1 (MT-1) genes in rats comprise a multigene family. We present the sequence of the MT-1 structural gene and compare its features with other metallothionein genes. Three MT-1 pseudogenes which we sequenced apparently arose by reverse transcription of processed mRNA transcripts. Two of these, MT-1ψc, are retrogenes which derive from the MT-1 mRNA, having diverged from the MT-1 gene 6.9 and 2.6 million years ago, respectively. The third, MT-1ψb, differs from the MT-1 cDNA by only three nucleotide alterations. Surprisingly, MT-1ψb also preserves sequence homology for 142 base pairs 5' to the transcription initiation site of the parent gene; it contains a promoter sequence sufficient for specifying metal ion induction. We identified, by S1 nuclease mapping, an RNA polymerase II initiation site 432 base pairs 5' of the MT-1 transcription initiation site of the MT-1 structural gene which could explain the formation of the mRNA precursor to this pseudogene. We were unable to detect MT-1ψb transcripts, either in liver tissue or after transfection. We conclude that the absence of detectable transcripts from this pseudogene is due to either a reduced level of transcription or the formation of unstable transcripts as a consequence of the lack of a consensus sequence normally found 3' of transcription termination in the MT-1 structural gene.
Expression of inducible 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6- bisphosphatase/PFKFB3 isoforms in adipocytes and their potential role in glycolytic regulation. 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase) catalyzes the synthesis and degradation of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP), which is a powerful activator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis. Four genes encode PFK-2/FBPase (PFKFB1-4), and an inducible isoform (iPFK-2/PFKFB3) has been found to mediate F2,6BP production in proliferating cells. We have investigated the role of iPFK-2/PFKFB3 and related isoforms in the regulation of glycolysis in adipocytes. Human visceral fat cells express PFKFB3 mRNA, and three alternatively spliced isoforms of iPFK-2/PFKFB3 are expressed in the epididymal fat pad of the mouse. Forced expression of the iPFK-2/PFKFB3 in COS-7 cells resulted in increased glucose uptake and cellular F2,6BP content. Prolonged insulin treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes led to reduced PFKFB3 mRNA expression, and epididymal fat pads from db/db mice also showed decreased expression of PFKFB3 mRNA. Finally, antiphospho-iPFK-2(Ser461) Western blotting revealed strong reactivity in insulin-treated 3T3-L1 adipocyte, suggesting that insulin induces the phosphorylation of PFKFB3 protein. These data expand the role of these structurally unique iPFK-2/PFKFB3 isoforms in the metabolic regulation of adipocytes.
Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor-2 controls gap junction intercellular communication by modulating endocytosis and degradation of connexin43. Gap junctions consist of arrays of intercellular channels that enable adjacent cells to communicate both electrically and metabolically. Gap junction channels are made of a family of integral membrane proteins called connexins, of which the best-studied member is connexin43. Gap junctions are dynamic plasma membrane domains, and connexin43 has a high turnover rate in most tissue types. However, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of connexin43 endocytosis and transport to lysosomes are still poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate by live-cell imaging analysis that treatment of cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) induces endocytosis of subdomains of connexin43 gap junctions. The internalized, connexin43-enriched vesicles were found to fuse with early endosomes, which was followed by transport of connexin43 to the lumen of early endosomes. The HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase smad ubiquitination regulatory factor-2 (Smurf2) was found to be recruited to connexin43 gap junctions in response to TPA treatment. Depletion of Smurf2 by small interfering RNA resulted in enhanced levels of connexin43 gap junctions between adjacent cells and increased gap junction intercellular communication. Smurf2 depletion also counteracted the TPA-induced endocytosis and degradation of connexin43. Collectively, these data identify Smurf2 as a novel regulator of connexin43 gap junctions.
DNA damage by bromate: Mechanism and consequences. Exposure of mammalian cells to bromate (BrO3-) generates oxidative DNA modifications, in particular 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-guanine (8-oxoG). The damaging mechanism is quite unique, since glutathione, which is protective against most oxidants and alkylating agents, mediates a metabolic activation, while bromate itself does not react directly with DNA. Neither enzymes nor transition metals are required as catalysts in the activation. The ultimate DNA damaging species has not yet been established, but experiments under cell-free conditions suggest that neither molecular bromine nor reactive oxygen species such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide or singlet oxygen are involved. Rather bromine radicals (Br) or oxides (BrO, BrO2) might be responsible. Compared to hypochlorite (ClO-), bromate is much less cytotoxic, probably because the former halite efficiently reacts with proteins and other vitally important cellular constituents. In consequence, oxidative DNA damage and the induction of mutations and micronuclei is easily detectable at non-cytotoxic concentrations of bromate, while DNA damage by hypochlorite is observed only at cytotoxic concentrations and follows a non-linear (hockey-stick-like) dose response.
Mechanical stretch activates signaling events for protein translation initiation and elongation in C2C12 myoblasts. It has been proposed that mechanically induced tension is the critical factor in the induction of muscle hypertrophy. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this process are still under investigation. In the present study, the effect of mechanical stretch on intracellular signaling for protein translation initiation and elongation was studied in C2C12 myoblasts. Cells were grown on a silicone elastomer chamber and subjected to 30-min of 5 or 15% constant static or cyclic (60 cycles/min) uniaxial stretch. Western blot analyses revealed that p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), which are the markers for translation initiation and peptide chain elongation, respectively, were activated by both static and cyclic stretch. The magnitude of activation was greater in response to the 15% cyclic stretch. Cyclic stretch also increased the phosphorylation of MAP kinases (p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and JNK). However, the pharmacological inhibition of MAP kinases did not block the stretch-induced activation of p70S6K and eEF2. An inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) blocked the stretch-induced phosphorylation of p70S6K but did not affect the eEF2 activation. A broad-range tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, blocked the stretch-induced activation of p70S6K and eEF2, whereas Src tyrosine kinase and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors did not. These results suggest that the stretch-induced activation of protein translation initiation and elongation in mouse myoblast cell lines is mediated by tyrosine kinase(s), except for Src kinase or JAK.
Association of ERCC5 Genetic Polymorphisms With Cirrhosis and Liver Cancer. Introduction: To explore association of excision repair cross-complementing 5 (ERCC5) genetic polymorphisms with cirrhosis and liver cancer. Methods: A total of 365 patients were enrolled, including control group (n = 133), cirrhosis group (n = 122), and liver cancer group (n = 110). The genotyping of ERCC5 rs2016073, rs751402, rs2094258, rs2296147, and rs2296148 was measured by using MassARRAY iPLEX technology. Results: There were no significant differences in gender and drinking among the 3 groups (P >.05). There were significant differences among the 3 groups in both age-group ≤60 and >60 subgroup patients. Locus rs2016073 was significantly different among 3 groups, and genotype GG (n = 0) was not observed in liver cancer group. As for locus rs751402, there were significant differences among 3 groups, and genotype AA (n = 0) was not observed in liver cancer group. As for locus rs2094258, there were no significant differences among 3 groups. Locus rs2296147 showed no significant differences among 3 groups (P >.05), but genotype CC was not observed in liver cancer group (n = 0). As for locus rs2296148, there were significant differences among 3 groups, and genotype TC (n = 0) was not observed in cirrhosis group. Regression analysis found locus rs751402 had significant difference between control group and cirrhosis group, patients with genotype AA and genotype GG were more likely to have cirrhosis than those with genotype GA. Conclusion: Our study suggested that genotype AA, genotype GG of ERCC5 locus rs751402, and genotype TC of locus rs2296148 may be important targets for cirrhosis, while ERCC5 polymorphisms (rs2016073 and ERCC5 polymorphisms, rs2016073 with genotype GG, and rs751402 with genotype AA) may be potential markers for liver cancer.
The role of nuclear hormone receptors in cutaneous wound repair. The cutaneous wound repair process involves balancing a dynamic series of events ranging from inflammation, oxidative stress, cell migration, proliferation, survival and differentiation. A complex series of secreted trophic factors, cytokines, surface and intracellular proteins are expressed in a temporospatial manner to restore skin integrity after wounding. Impaired initiation, maintenance or termination of the tissue repair processes can lead to perturbed healing, necrosis, fibrosis or even cancer. Nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) in the cutaneous environment regulate tissue repair processes such as fibroplasia and angiogenesis. Defects in functional NHRs and their ligands are associated with the clinical phenotypes of chronic non-healing wounds and skin endocrine disorders. The functional relationship between NHRs and skin niche cells such as epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts is pivotal for successful wound closure and permanent repair. The aim of this review is to delineate the cutaneous effects and cross-talk of various nuclear receptors upon injury towards functional tissue restoration.
Down-regulation of PKCζ in renal cell carcinoma and its clinicopathological implications.. Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is highly resistant to systemic chemotherapy. Unfortunately, nearly all patients die of the metastatic and chemoresistant RCC. Recent studies have shown the atypical PKCζ is an important regulator of tumorigenesis. However, the correlation between PKCζ expression and the clinical outcome in RCC patients is unclear. We examined the level of PKCζ expression in human RCC. PKCζ mRNA and protein expressions were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) respectively in RCC tissues of 144 patients. Cellular cytotoxicity and proliferation were assessed by MTT. PKCζ expression was significantly higher in normal than in cancerous tissues (P<0.0001) by real-time PCR and IHC. Similarly, PKCζ expression was down-regulated in four renal cancer cell lines compared to immortalized benign renal tubular cells. Interestingly, an increase of PKCζ expression was associated with the elevated tumor grade (P=0.04), but no such association was found in TNM stage (P=0.13). Tumors with higher PKCζ expression were associated with tumor size (P=0.048). Expression of higher PKCζ found a poor survival in patients with high tumor grade. Down-regulation of PKCζ showed the significant chemoresistance in RCC cell lines. Inactivation of PKCζ expression enhanced cellular resistance to cisplatin and paclitaxel, and proliferation in HK-2 cells by specific PKCζ siRNA and inhibitor. PKCζ expression was associated with tumorigenesis and chemoresistance in RCC.
Conformational isomerism, rotational allomerism, and divergent evolution in immunoglobulin light chains.. Immunoglobulin light chains are examples of single polypeptide chains synthesized under the control of two genes. The three-dimensional structure of a human (Mcg) lambda-type chain (Bence-Jones) dimer supports the hypothesis of a common primordial gene for the amino ("variable" or V) and carboxyl ("constant" or C) halves of each monomer. However, sequence homologies have been obscurred by divergent evolution of the V and C regions ("domains"). The types of evolutionary changes that have occurred in the domain can be surmised by a comparison of the sequences, using the three-dimensional structures as a basis for alignment. Despite substantial differences in sequences, the hydrophobic character of key internal sites has been maintained in each domain. Regions present in only one domain are situated in position appropriate for their functions, but not deleterious to the general structural integrity of a common fold. The divergence of the V and C domains can be interpreted in terms of rotational allomerism. The cylinders of beta-pleated sheets have rotated in such a way that homologous regions in the two domains perform different functions in their interactions with a second molecule of light or heavy chain. These regions include complementarity-determining sites for antigen binding in the V domains and crossover sites stabilizing dimer formation in the C domains. Differences in surface properties between the V1-V2 and C1-C2 dimeric modules may partially explain why the V regions have been implicated in the formation of amyloid fibrils and in the characteristic thermal behavior of Bence-Jones proteins.
An epitranscriptomic mechanism underlies selective mRNA translation remodelling in melanoma persister cells. Cancer persister cells tolerate anticancer drugs and serve as the founders of acquired resistance and cancer relapse. Here we show that a subpopulation of BRAFV600 mutant melanoma cells that tolerates exposure to BRAF and MEK inhibitors undergoes a reversible remodelling of mRNA translation that evolves in parallel with drug sensitivity. Although this process is associated with a global reduction in protein synthesis, a subset of mRNAs undergoes an increased efficiency in translation. Inhibiting the eIF4A RNA helicase, a component of the eIF4F translation initiation complex, abrogates this selectively increased translation and is lethal to persister cells. Translation remodelling in persister cells coincides with an increased N6-methyladenosine modification in the 5′-untranslated region of some highly translated mRNAs. Combination of eIF4A inhibitor with BRAF and MEK inhibitors effectively inhibits the emergence of persister cells and may represent a new therapeutic strategy to prevent acquired drug resistance.
Hepatic expression profiling identifies steatosis-independent and steatosis-driven advanced fibrosis genes. Chronic liver disease (CLD) is associated with tissue-destructive fibrosis. Considering that common mechanisms drive fibrosis across etiologies, and that steatosis is an important cofactor for pathology, we performed RNA sequencing on liver biopsies of patients with different fibrosis stages, resulting from infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) (with or without steatosis) or fatty liver disease. In combination with enhanced liver fibrosis score correlation analysis, we reveal a common set of genes associated with advanced fibrosis, as exemplified by those encoding the transcription factor ETS-homologous factor (EHF) and the extracellular matrix protein versican (VCAN). We identified 17 fibrosis-associated genes as candidate EHF targets and demonstrated that EHF regulates multiple fibrosis-associated genes, including VCAN, in hepatic stellate cells. Serum VCAN levels were also elevated in advanced fibrosis patients. Comparing biopsies from patients with HCV with or without steatosis, we identified a steatosis-enriched gene set associated with advanced fibrosis, validating follistatin-like protein 1 (FSTL1) as an exemplar of this profile. In patients with advanced fibrosis, serum FSTL1 levels were elevated in those with steatosis (versus those without). Liver Fstl1 mRNA levels were also elevated in murine CLD models. We thus reveal a common gene signature for CLD-associated liver fibrosis and potential biomarkers and/or targets for steatosis-associated liver fibrosis.
'Enhanced Function of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Endothelial Cells Through ESM1 Signaling. The mortality rate for (cardio)-vascular disease is one of the highest in the world, so a healthy functional endothelium is of outmost importance against vascular disease. In this study, human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells were reprogrammed from 1 ml blood of healthy donors and subsequently differentiated into endothelial cells (iPS-ECs) with typical EC characteristics. This research combined iPS cell technologies and next-generation sequencing to acquire an insight into the transcriptional regulation of iPS-ECs. We identified endothelial cell-specific molecule 1 (ESM1) as one of the highest expressed genes during EC differentiation, playing a key role in EC enrichment and function by regulating connexin 40 (CX40) and eNOS. Importantly, ESM1 enhanced the iPS-ECs potential to improve angiogenesis and neovascularisation in in vivo models of angiogenesis and hind limb ischemia. These findings demonstrated for the first time that enriched functional ECs are derived through cell reprogramming and ESM1 signaling, opening the horizon for drug screening and cell-based therapies for vascular diseases. Therefore, this study showcases a new approach for enriching and enhancing the function of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived ECs from a very small amount of blood through ESM1 signaling, which greatly enhances their functionality and increases their therapeutic potential.
Repurposing screen identifies Amlodipine as an inducer of PD-L1 degradation and antitumor immunity. Cancer cell expression of PD-L1 leads to T cells exhaustion by transducing co-inhibitory signal, and further understanding the regulation of PD-L1 in cancer cells may provide additional therapeutic strategies. Here by drug repurposing screen, we identified amlodipine as a potent inhibitor of PD-L1 expression in cancer cells. Further survey of calcium-associated pathways revealed calpain-dependent stabilization of the PD-L1 protein. Intracellular calcium delivered an operational signal to calpain-dependent Beclin-1 cleavage, blocking autophagic degradation of PD-L1 accumulated on recycling endosome (RE). Blocking calcium flux by amlodipine depleted PD-L1 expression and increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration in tumor tissues but not in myocardium, causing dose-dependent tumor suppression in vivo. Rescuing PD-L1 expression eliminated the effects of amlodipine, suggesting the PD-L1-dependent effect of amlodipine. These results reveal a calcium-dependent mechanism controlling PD-L1 degradation, and highlight calcium flux blockade as a potential strategy for combinatorial immunotherapy.
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and regulation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Evasion of apoptosis represents a key mechanism leading to treatment resistance of human cancers. Abnormal regulation of chromatin remodeling has been implied in tumorigenesis as well as treatment resistance. Acetylation of histones represents one of the key posttranslational modifications that contribute to the regulation of chromatin remodeling. Histone acetylation is governed by the balance between enzymes that put acetyl groups on histone tails or, alternatively, remove them. Since a disturbed regulation of histone acetylation plays an important role in cancer formation and progression, a variety of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been developed in recent years to target aberrant HDAC activity. HDAC inhibitors also represent a promising strategy to lower the threshold of cancer cells for apoptosis induction. For example, synergistic induction of apoptosis has been documented for the concomitant use of HDAC inhibitors together with the death receptor ligand TRAIL in a panel of human cancers. Understanding the molecular mechanism that mediates this synergistic drug interaction will be critical to further optimize this approach in order to successfully translate it into a clinical setting.
Identification and characterization of a phosphorylation-activated, cyclic AMP and Ca2+-independent protein kinase in the brain.. A cyclic AMP and calcium-independent protein kinase has been identified and purified from pig brain to near homogeneity. This independent protein kinase was isolated in an inactive form, and activation required ATP and Mg2+. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the purified enzyme contains 1 subunit with a molecular mass of about 36 kDa. Although there was no significant phosphorylation of phosphorylase, phosphorylase b kinase, casein, phosvitin, and protamine, this kinase was found to be very active toward myelin basic protein and histones H1, 2A, and 2B. Trypsinolysis completely destroyed the kinase activity, indicating that this is not a protease-activated protein kinase. More interesting, this cAMP and calcium-independent protein kinase can be regulated by its state of phosphorylation. In its non-phosphorylated state, the kinase was essentially inactive but could be fully activated when the enzyme was phosphorylated up to a 1:1 molar ratio. Conversely, partial dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated enzyme was associated with a time-dependent decrease in the kinase activity and a loss of 32P. All the results taken together point out that this kinase is distinguished from all the reported protein kinases and may represent a previously undiscovered protein kinase. The results also provide initial evidence that a cascade activation mechanism may possibly be involved in the regulation of a protein kinase activity which is independent of cAMP and calcium.
Antiproliferative effect of SOCS-1 through the suppression of STAT3 and p38 MAPK activation in gastric cancer cells. Inflammation is a crucial driving force in the development of gastric cancers (GCs). Accordingly, persistent activation of STAT3, a transcription factor pivotal in regulating both inflammation and oncogenesis, is often detected in GC, although its mechanism remains elusive. Suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1) is a negative regulator of proinflammatory cytokine signaling and SOCS-1 gene methylation is frequently detected in various cancers including GC. However, the significance of SOCS-1 methylation in GC cells remains unexplored. Our study is undertaken to evaluate the role of SOCS-1 in GC cell proliferation and its effect on signaling pathways in GC cells. Among five GC cell lines, SOCS-1 gene was methylated in all cell lines and constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation with elevated endogenous IL-6 production was detected in two cell lines (NUGC-3 and AGS). Unexpectedly, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited neither cell proliferation nor STAT3 phosphorylation in NUGC-3 and AGS. In contrast, enforced SOCS-1 expression by adenoviral vector (AdSOCS-1) markedly suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation and proliferation of NUGC-3 and AGS cells in vitro. Interestingly, the antiproliferative effect of SOCS-1 was attributable not only to the inhibition of STAT3 but also to that of p38 MAPK activity, and chemical inhibitors of JAK/STAT and p38 MAPK signaling effectively suppressed proliferation of these GC cells. Furthermore, treatment with AdSOCS-1 in vivo significantly suppressed GC proliferation in a xenograft model. These results suggest that SOCS-1 gene methylation is a critical step in the development of GC, and enforced expression of SOCS-1 may represent a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of GC.
A rho-associated protein kinase: Differentially distributed in limbal and corneal epithelia. PURPOSE. The authors have developed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to characterize the sequential biochemical changes in corneal epithelial cells after they differentiate from stem cells, located in the limbus, and migrate centripetally to follow the pathway of terminal differentiation. The purpose of this study was to identify a protein (recognized by mAb HE1/11f) with increased expression associated with the transition of the limbal epithelium to corneal epithelium. METHODS. The distribution and identification of the protein(s) were performed using an indirect immunohistochemical staining technique and a western blot analysis, respectively. A rabbit corneal epithelial cDNA library, constructed in the Uni-Zap XR vector, was screened with mAb HE1/11F to select cDNA clones expressing polypeptide(s) recognized by this mAb. Additional overlapping cDNA clones were obtained from a primer extension cDNA library to determine the sequence of the complete open reading frame encoding the protein recognized by mAb HE1/11F. RESULTS. Rabbit corneal epithelium exhibited strong immunostaining with mAb HE1/11F, however, the limbal epithelial cells stained weakly. HE1/11F recognized 160kDa (HEBM1) and 100-kDa (HEBM2) polypeptides in the corneal epithelial extracts. The amino acid sequence of the protein deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA exhibited a close homology to that of a RhoA (Ras-related small GTPase)- associated serine-threonine kinase (ROCK-I or Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase). A 160kDa RhoA-binding polypeptide with a molecular mass similar to that of HEBM1 and ROCK-I was detected in the corneal epithelial extracts. These findings strongly suggested that HEBM1 was rabbit ROCK-I. The identity of HEBM1 was further confirmed from the reactivity of mAb HE1/11F with ROCK- I immunoprecipitated from rabbit corneal epithelial extracts using anti- ROCK-I antibodies. CONCLUSIONS. The increased expression of a protein identified as ROCK-I from cDNA analyses is associated with rabbit corneal epithelial differentiation and transition from the limbal to corneal surface. Therefore, a RhoA signaling pathway is likely to be associated with corneal epithelial differentiation (maturation). A close homology among the cDNA se- quences of rabbit, mouse, rat, and human ROCK-I indicates that this RhoA- associated kinase is a well-conserved protein.
The E1B transcription map of the enteric adenovirus type 41. Enteric adenovirus type 41 (Ad41) is defective for growth in conventional established cell lines. Ad41 is dependent on the Ads early regions E1A/E1B since it cannot grow in HEK cells but only in 293 HEK cells transformed by Ad5 E1 region. However, Hep-2 cells have also been shown to support the growth of Ad41 to some extent. The nucleotide sequence of the E1B region of the Ad41 strain D389 has been determined. When compared to the corresponding region of the Ad41 prototype strain (Tak) the degree of homology in the DNA sequences was close to 100%. The mRNAs from the E1B region of the Ad41 strain D389 have been studied by Northern blot, primer extension, and polymerase chain reaction-cDNA analysis. E1B transcripts corresponding to Ad2 14 S, 22 S, and 9 S mRNAs were identified but no 13 S mRNA equivalent was detected, a pattern similar to that seen in the Ad40 and Adl2 transcription maps. However, the Ad41 E1B 14S mRNA equivalent has one additional small exon of 23 nucleotides, created by a donor and an acceptor splice site located at positions not seen in other E1B transcripts of human adenoviruses analyzed so far. The coding potential for E1B 19K, 55K, and 15K proteins and for pIX is retained in the Ad41 transcripts. In contrast to other adenoviruses, except for the closely related Ad40, the ORF of pIX starts in the intron of the 22 S mRNA.
Expanding the phenotype associated to KMT2A variants: overlapping clinical signs between Wiedemann–Steiner and Rubinstein–Taybi syndromes. Lysine-specific methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A) is responsible for methylation of histone H3 (K4H3me) and contributes to chromatin remodeling, acting as “writer” of the epigenetic machinery. Mutations in KMT2A were first reported in Wiedemann–Steiner syndrome (WDSTS). More recently, KMT2A variants have been described in probands with a specific clinical diagnosis comprised in the so-called chromatinopathies. Such conditions, including WDSTS, are a group of overlapping disorders caused by mutations in genes coding for the epigenetic machinery. Among them, Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is mainly caused by heterozygous pathogenic variants in CREBBP or EP300. In this work, we used next generation sequencing (either by custom-made panel or by whole exome) to identify alternative causative genes in individuals with a RSTS-like phenotype negative to CREBBP and EP300 mutational screening. In six patients we identified different novel unreported variants in KMT2A gene. The identified variants are de novo in at least four out of six tested individuals and all of them display some typical RSTS phenotypic features but also WDSTS specific signs. This study reinforces the concept that germline variants affecting the epigenetic machinery lead to a shared molecular effect (alteration of the chromatin state) determining superimposable clinical conditions.
Circulating long non-coding RNA GAS5 and SOX2OT as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer. Early diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is essential for patient treatment and prognosis. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) have potential roles in tumor initiation and differentiation. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the circulating lncRNA, growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) and SOX2 overlapping transcript (SOX2OT), could be used as noninvasive biomarkers for NSCLC diagnosis. Moreover, we aimed at evaluating the association between lncRNA and the clinicopathological features of NSCLC in order to predict the cancer prognosis. The results showed significant downregulation of GAS5 expression and upregulation of SOX2OT in NSCLC patients compared with controls (P\xa0<\xa00.001). Furthermore, the expression level of GAS5 was declined in stage IV of NSCLC, but SOX2OT expression was increased sharply in stages III and IV. The expression levels of lncRNAs were used to distinguish NSCLC patients from control with an area under curve of 0.81 (sensitivity 82.5% and specificity 80%) for GAS5 and 0.73 (sensitivity 76.3% and specificity 78.6%) for SOX2OT. The combination of GAS5 and SOX2OT showed differentiation NSCLC patients from controls with increased sensitivity (83.8) and specificity (81.4). In conclusion, the newly developed diagnostic panel involving of circulating GAS5 and SOX2OT could be perfect biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of NSCLC.
Estrogen, progesterone and hippocampal plasticity in rodent models. Accumulating evidence indicates that ovarian hormones regulate a wide variety of non-reproductive functions in the central nervous system by interacting with several molecular and cellular processes. A growing animal literature using both adult and aged rodent models indicates that 17β-estradiol (E2), the most potent of the biologically relevant estrogens, and progesterone (P4), a major naturally occurring progestogen, facilitate some forms of learning and memory, in particular those that involve hippocampal-dependent tasks. A recently developed triple-transgenic mouse (3xTg-AD) has been widely used as an animal model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as this mouse exhibits an age-related and progressive neuropathological phenotype that includes both plaque and tangle pathology mainly restricted to hippocampus, amygdala and cerebral cortex. In this report, we examine recent studies that compare the effects of ovarian hormones on synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity in adult and aged rodents. A better understanding of the non-reproductive functions of ovarian hormones has farreaching implications for hormone therapy to maintain health and function within the nervous system throughout aging.
'Effects of ADIPOQ polymorphisms on PCOS risk: A meta-analysis. Background: Whether adiponectin (ADIPOQ) polymorphisms are associated with the risk of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) remain controversial. Therefore, we performed this study to better explore correlations between ADIPOQ polymorphisms and PCOS risk. Methods: Literature retrieve was conducted in PubMed, Medline and Embase. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: Eighteen studies were enrolled for analyses. Pooled overall analyses showed that rs1501299 polymorphism was significantly associated with PCOS risk (recessive model: p = 0.02, OR = 0.77, 95%CI 0.62-0.95; allele model: p = 0.001, OR = 1.15, 95%CI 1.06-1.26). Further subgroup analyses according to ethnicity of participants revealed that rs1501299 and rs2241766 polymorphisms were both significantly correlated with PCOS risk in Caucasians. In addition, rs1501299 polymorphism was also significantly correlated with PCOS risk in East Asians. Conclusions: Our findings indicated that rs1501299 and rs2241766 polymorphisms might serve as genetic biomarkers of PCOS in certain ethnicities.
Reduced cholesterol absorption upon PPARδ activation coincides with decreased intestinal expression of NPC1L1. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) control the transcription of genes involved in lipid metabolism. Activation of PPARδ may have antiatherogenic effects through the increase of plasma HDL, theoretically promoting reverse cholesterol transport from peripheral tissues toward the liver for removal via bile and feces. Effects of PPARδ activation by GW610742 were evaluated in wild-type and Abca1 deficient (Abca1-/-) mice that lack HDL. Treatment with GW610742 resulted in an ∼50% increase of plasma HDL-cholesterol in wild-type mice, whereas plasma cholesterol levels remained extremely low in Abca1-/- mice. Yet, biliary cholesterol secretion rates were similar in untreated wild-type and Abca1-/- mice and unaltered upon treatment. Unexpectedly, PPARδ activation led to enhanced fecal neutral sterol loss in both groups without any changes in intestinal Abca1, Abcg5, Abcg8, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl- coenzyme A reductase expression. Moreover, GW610742 treatment resulted in a 43% reduction of fractional cholesterol absorption in wild-type mice, coinciding with a significantly reduced expression of the cholesterol absorption protein Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (Npc1l1) in the intestine. PPARδ activation is associated with increased plasma HDL and reduced intestinal cholesterol absorption efficiency that may be related to decreased intestinal Npc1l1 expression. Thus, PPARδ is a promising target for drugs aimed to treat or prevent atherosclerosis.
A gain-of-functional screen identifies the Hippo pathway as a central mediator of receptor tyrosine kinases during tumorigenesis. The Hippo pathway has emerged as a key signaling pathway that regulates various biological functions. Dysregulation of the Hippo pathway has been implicated in a broad range of human cancer types. While a number of stimuli affecting the Hippo pathway have been reported, its upstream kinase and extracellular regulators remain largely unknown. Here we performed the first comprehensive gain-of-functional screen for receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) regulating the Hippo pathway using an RTK overexpression library and a Hippo signaling activity biosensor. Surprisingly, we found that the majority of RTKs could regulate the Hippo signaling activity. We further characterized several of these novel relationships [TAM family members (TYRO3, AXL, METRK), RET, and FGFR family members (FGFR1 and FGFR2)] and found that the Hippo effectors YAP/TAZ are central mediators of the tumorigenic phenotypes (e.g., increased cell proliferation, transformation, increased cell motility, and angiogenesis) induced by these RTKs and their extracellular ligands (Gas6, GDNF, and FGF) through either PI3K or MAPK signaling pathway. Significantly, we identify FGFR, RET, and MERTK as the first RTKs that can directly interact with and phosphorylate YAP/TAZ at multiple tyrosine residues independent of upstream Hippo signaling, thereby activating their functions in tumorigenesis. In conclusion, we have identified several novel kinases and extracellular stimuli regulating the Hippo pathway. Our findings also highlight the pivotal role of the Hippo pathway in mediating Gas6/GDNF/FGF-TAM/RET/FGFR-MAPK/PI3K signaling during tumorigenesis and provide a compelling rationale for targeting YAP/TAZ in RTK-driven cancers.
The relationship between apoptosis, chromatin configuration, histone modification and competence of oocytes: A study using the mouse ovary-holding stress model. The epigenetic factors causing competence differences between SN (surrounded nucleolus) and NSN (non-surrounded nucleolus) oocytes, the significance for the increased histone acetylation and methylation in SN oocytes, and whether chromatin configuration or histone modification determines oocyte competence, are unclear. This study has addressed these issues by using the ovary-holding (OH) stress models where oocyte SN configuration was uncoupled from histone modifications and developmental potential. Prepubertal mouse ovaries containing high percentages of NSN oocytes were preserved at 37 or 39 °C for 1 or 2 h before examination for oocyte chromatin configuration, developmental competence, histone modification and apoptosis. Whereas 1-h OH at 37 °C caused a moderate apoptosis with increased oocyte competence, improved histone modification and a normal NSN-to-SN transition, harsher OH conditions induced a severe apoptosis with decreased oocyte competence, impaired histone modification and a pseudo (premature) NSN-to-SN transition. Observations on Fas/FasL expression and using the gld (generalized lymphoproliferative disorder) mice harboring FasL mutations indicated that OH triggered oocyte apoptosis with activation of the Fas signaling. It was concluded that OH stress caused oocyte apoptosis with activation of the Fas/FasL system and that oocyte competence was more closely correlated with histone modification than with chromatin configuration.
BMCP1, a novel mitochondrial carrier with high expression in the central nervous system of humans and rodents, and respiration uncoupling activity in recombinant yeast. We report here the cloning and functional analysis of a novel homologue of the mitochondrial carriers predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and referred to as BMCP1 (brain mitochondrial carrier protein-1). The predicted amino acid sequence of this novel mitochondrial carrier indicates a level of identity of 39, 31, or 30%, toward the mitochondrial oxoglutarate carrier, phosphate carrier, or adenine nucleotide translocator, respectively, and a level of identity of 34, 38, or 39% with the mitochondrial uncoupling proteins UCP1, UCP2, or UCP3, respectively. Northern analysis of mouse, rat, or human tissues demonstrated that mRNA of this novel gene is mainly expressed in brain, although it is 10-30-fold less expressed in other tissues. In situ hybridization analysis of brain showed it is particularly abundant in cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, and hypothalamus. Chromosomal mapping indicates that BMCP1 is located on chromosome X of mice and at Xq24 in man. Expression of the protein in yeast strongly impaired growth rate. Analysis of respiration of total recombinant yeast or yeast spheroplasts and in particular of the relationship between respiratory rate and membrane potential of yeast spheroplasts revealed a marked uncoupling activity of respiration, suggesting that although BMCP1 sequence is more distant from the uncoupling proteins (UCPs), this protein could be a fourth member of the UCP family.
Pediatric brain tumor cells release exosomes with a miRNA repertoire that differs from exosomes secreted by normal cells. High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are very aggressive brain tumors with a cancer stem cell component. Cells, including cancer stem cells, release vesicles called exosomes which contain small non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs). These are thought to play an important role in cell-cell communication. However, we have limited knowledge of the types of exosomal miRNAs released by pediatric HGG stem cells; a prerequisite for exploring their potential roles in HGG biology. Here we isolated exosomes released by pediatric glioma stem cells (GSCs) and compared their repertoire of miRNAs to genetically normal neural stem cells (NSCs) exosomes, as well as their respective cellular miRNA content. Whereas cellular miRNAs are similar, we find that the exosomal miRNA profiles differ between normal and tumor cells, and identify several differentially expressed miRNAs. Of particular interest is miR-1290 and miR-1246, which have previously been linked to 'stemness' and invasion in other cancers. We demonstrate that GSC-secreted exosomes influence the gene expression of receiving NSCs, particularly targeting genes with a role in cell fate and tumorigenesis. Thus, our study shows that GSCs and NSCs have similar cellular miRNA profiles, yet differ significantly in the repertoire of exosomal miRNAs and these could influence malignant features of HGG.
Abnormal DNA methylation in CD4+ T cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, and dermatomyositis. Objectives: T-cell DNA hypomethylation is thought to contribute to the development of systemic erythematosus lupus (SLE). However, it is unknown whether impaired T-cell DNA methylation occurs in other connective tissue diseases, such as systemic sclerosis (SSc) and dermatomyositis (DM). Methods: We quantified global methylation in CD4+ T cells from 12 healthy donors and patients with SLE, SSc, and DM (10 patients in each group). mRNA levels of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins (MBDs) were measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: CD4+ T-cell DNA from patients with SLE (both active and inactive) and SSc, but not DM, was significantly hypomethylated relative to controls. The average expression levels of DNMT1 and MBD4 mRNA were significantly lower whereas MBD2 and MeCP2 mRNA levels were significantly higher in the SLE group. DNMT1, MBD3, and MBD4 mRNA was significantly decreased in the SSc group, whereas MBD2 and MeCP2 mRNA was significantly higher in the DM group. The degree of global DNA hypomethylation correlated positively with the relative level of DNMT1 across SLE samples and MBD4 across the SSc samples. Conclusion: Reduced DNA methylation and abnormal expression of methylation-related genes in CD4+ T cells are associated with SLE and SSc.
Towards systemic sclerosis and away from primary biliary cirrhosis: The case of PTPN22. Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by immune-mediated destruction of the small and medium size intrahepatic bile ducts. PBC patients often have concomitant autoimmune diseases, which are most often autoimmune thyroid disease, as well as Sicca syndrome. Occasionally, some PBC patients will also have systemic sclerosis of the limited cutaneous type (lcSSc). Conversely, up to one-fourth of SSc patients are positive for antimitochondrial antibody, the serologic hallmark of PBC. It is also common for SSc patients to have concomitant autoimmune disease, which may include PBC in rare cases. This has led to speculation of shared environmental and/or genetic factors, which lead to the development of PBC in SSc patients and vice versa. Recent genetic studies have revealed associations with several genes in both SSc and PBC. PTPN22 is one gene that has been associated with SSc, but not with PBC. It may be argued that some SSc patients with a particular genotype, which shares genes found in both conditions may develop PBC. Likewise, particular genes such as PTPN22 may infer susceptibility to SSc alone. The presence of PTPN22 may also contribute to the development of SSc in PBC patients. The lack of a large number of overlapping genes may, in part, explain the relative rarity of PBC with SSc and vice versa. This review will examine the literature surrounding the genetic associations of PBC and SSc, and the role of PTPN22 in particular.
Regulation of insulin-like growth factor I transcription by prostaglandin E2 in osteoblast cells. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is a widely expressed abundant autocrine and paracrine factor that regulates the proliferation and differentiation of a variety of cell types. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a potent stimulator of IGF-I synthesis in bone. We examined the regulation of IGF-I synthesis by PGE2 in osteoblast-enriched (Ob) cells from fetal rat calvaria. PGE2 treatment of Ob cells at 1 microM for 2 h resulted in a 5-fold increase in heterogeneous nuclear RNA levels, as measured by a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay, suggesting an increase in IGF-I gene transcription. RNase protection analysis was used to map the transcriptional start sites in the IGF-I gene that are used in Ob cells. Consistent with other extrahepatic tissues, initiation of transcription occurs primarily at three sites within the 5′-regions of exon 1 of the IGF-I gene. PGE2 treatment did not alter start site usage. The regions upstream of these transcriptional start sites were analyzed by transiently transfecting Ob cells with putative rat IGF-I promoter sequences ligated to a luciferase reporter gene. Constructs containing 1.4 kilobases of the 5′-regions regions of exons 1 and 2 had significant promoter activity. PGE2 treatment of transfected Ob cells increased luciferase activity 5-fold when a 1.4-kilobase exon 1 promoter fragment was tested. This increase in luciferase activity was time and dose dependent. Smaller regions of the exon 1 promoter sequence gave higher basal activity and were less responsive to PGE2. We conclude that regions involved in IGF-I regulation by PGE2 are contained within the IGF-I promoter.
